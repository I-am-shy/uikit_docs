# How to Call Server API Online

You can call the server API online in the ZEGOCLOUD server API documentation page to quickly test and verify the functionality of the API. Please use the signature generator to generate the necessary request parameters for the API, and then go to the corresponding interface page for debugging.

## Use Online Signature Generator to Generate API Required Request Parameters

Please get the AppId and ServerSecret from the [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zego.im), then fill in the following input box and click the Generate button to generate the signature.

<Note title="Note">The operation of calculating the signature is completed on the client side, and no data is sent to the server.</Note>
<Warning title="Attention">
- Please make sure the AppId and ServerSecret are correct.
- The generated signature is used for authentication when calling the server API.
- The signature is time-sensitive, so please use it promptly. If the interface returns an error indicating that the signature has expired, please generate a new one.
</Warning>
