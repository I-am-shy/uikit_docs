# Accessing Server APIs
---

## Usage notes

ZEGOCLOUD server API supports the HTTPS protocol and allows you to call the GET or POST method.

## Overview

A server API request consists of different parts and has a fixed request structure.

- [Endpoint](#endpoint): The endpoint of the ZEGOCLOUD server. The endpoint differs based on different services and regions.
- [Common parameters](#common-parameters): Each request must contain a series of common parameters.
- [Signature](#signing-the-requests): The signature is a common parameter that must be generated by using a signature algorithm.
- Request parameters: You must specify an operation by setting the `Action` parameter. Example: `Action = CreateMetaHumanVideo`. In addition, you must set other parameters for the specified operation.

After the request is verified based on your signature, the verification result is returned. If a call is successful, response parameters are returned. If the call failed, an error is reported. You can troubleshoot the error based on [Return Codes](./return-codes.mdx).

## Request structure

### Endpoint

| Product | Endpoint |
|-|-|
| Digital Human AI Platform Service | aigc-digitalhuman-api.zegotech.cn |

### Communication Protocol

For secure communications, all the Server APIs must be accessed via HTTPS requests.

### Request methods

The  server API supports the following HTTP Request methods:

- GET
- POST


<Note title="Note">
For a GET request, all request parameters (including common parameters and business-related parameters) should be placed in the Query. For a POST request, special and complex parameters can be placed in the Request Body.
</Note>

## Common parameters

This section introduces the common parameters used by developers when calling ZEGOCLOUD server APIs, including common request parameters and common response parameters.

### Common Request Parameters

Common request parameters are the parameters that are required for every API request.

| Parameter         | Type     | Required | Description                                   |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| AppId             | Uint32   | Yes      | The unique Application ID assigned to your project by ZEGOCLOUD. Get it from the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/). |
| Signature         | String   | Yes      | The API request signature. Refer to [Signing the requests](#signing-the-requests) for how to generate an API request signature. |
| SignatureNonce    | String   | Yes      | A random string.                                |
| SignatureVersion  | String   | Yes      | The version of the signature. Default value: 2.0. |
| Timestamp         | Number    | Yes      | Unix timestamp, in seconds. A maximum error of 10 minutes is allowed. |

<Warning title="Warning">
- Do not directly copy the examples below for requests.
- In the following codes, the `Action=xxxxx` in `https://aigc-digitalhuman-api.zegotech.cn/?Action=xxxxx` needs to be replaced with the request address in the "Interface Prototype" section of each API document.
- The values of the common parameters should be modified according to the actual situation.
</Warning>

Request example:
<CodeGroup>
```json title="POST request"
https://aigc-digitalhuman-api.zegotech.cn/?Action=xxx
&AppId=1234567890
&SignatureNonce=15215528852396
&Timestamp=1234567890
&Signature=xxxx
&SignatureVersion=2.0
```

```json title="GET request"
https://aigc-digitalhuman-api.zegotech.cn/?Action=xxx
&AppId=1234567890
&SignatureNonce=15215528852396
&Timestamp=1234567890
&Signature=xxxx
&SignatureVersion=2.0
&<Non-common request parameters>
```
</CodeGroup>

### 公共返回参数

All responses to API requests are returned in a unified format, with the returned data in JSON format.

The following common response parameters will be included in the response to every request, regardless of whether the request is successful.

| Parameter  | Type       | Description             |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| Code       | Number     | Return code.            |
| Message    | String     | Request result description. |
| Data    | -      |Response object. For more details, see the response parameters for each API.  |

Sample Response:

```json
{
    "Code":0,
    "Data":{
        "MessageId":"1_1611647493487_29"
    },
    "Message":"success"
}
```
