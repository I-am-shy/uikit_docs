# Image and Audio Collection Guide

---


This document describes how to collect image and audio samples.

<Note title="Note">
Images and audio can be collected separately. You do not have to use the camera to record audio.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

Contact the customer service personnel of ZEGOCLOUD ([aigc@zegocloud.com](mailto:aigc@zegocloud.com)) to activate the image customization or audio clone service.

## Image Collection

The image collection process consists of four steps: hardware preparation, site preparation, shooting, and file submission.

### 1. Prepare hardware

Configure your shooting hardware according to one of the following two sets of parameter requirements.

| | Parameter Requirement Set 1 | Parameter Requirement Set 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Recording specifications | <ul><li>PAL (Phase Alternation by Line)</li><li>4K 50P</li></ul> | <ul><li>PAL (Phase Alternation by Line)</li><li>1080p 50P</li></ul> |
| Recording duration | ≥12 min | ≥12 min |
| Camera encoding format, bitrate, and sampling standard | <ul><li>H.264</li><li>No requirements on bitrate</li><li>At least 8-bit color depth (10-bit at 4:2:2 is recommended)</li></ul> | <ul><li>H.264</li><li>Maximum bitrate supported</li><li>At least 8-bit color depth (10-bit at 4:2:2 is recommended)</li></ul> |
| Precautions | N/A | When recording at 1080P resolution, ensure that the model occupies as many pixels as possible in the frame and does not move out of the frame. |

### 2. Set up the site

Set up the site with a green background to allow for digital effects later. Make sure the green background is flat without obvious folds. You can use a piece of scroll paper or a green screen.

If you opt for a green screen, use strong clips to stretch the screen as flat as possible to avoid uneven light due to folds, which will cause difficulties in image cutout and affect the final effect.

### 3. Start shooting

During shooting, the model and the director need to take note of the following precautions to produce optimal shooting effects.

#### Precautions for models

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Look | <ul><li>The mode's clothes should not be bright green, and their materials should not be strongly reflective or translucent (such as fringe and lace) and should <strong>contain no fine stripes or mesh fabrics</strong>, so as to avoid the moire pattern that affects watching experience.<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/dont_model_hair.png" /></Frame></li><li>The model's silhouette should be as smooth and clear as possible to <strong>avoid the formation of small perspective areas due to the hollowing out of the edges of the hair</strong>, in which case watchers can see the green background through the hair.If accessories (such as earrings, ribbons, scarves, and tassels) extend beyond the model's silhouette or swing with the model's movements, replace or secure them.</li><li>No small areas of highlighted green items such as emerald rings, bracelets, and necklaces should be visible on the model's body.</li></ul> |
| Beginning and end | At the beginning and end of shooting, the model should hold a <strong>Silent Pose</strong> for 10s. The specifics of the silent pose are up to the model. For example, a Silent Pose can include a closed mouth and still limbs with no other body movements. The Silent Pose also applies to rhythmic pauses during shooting. |
| Rhythmic pause | The model should hold a pause of about 2s between every three or four sentences, with the mouth closed and the body movements restored to the <strong>Silent Pose</strong>. |
| Recording and lip movement | <ul><li>The model should speak at a steady speed and volume throughout the shooting process.</li><li>Any situation where the model opens the mouth but does not make a sound is prohibited.</li><li>The model should speak with obvious lip movements to help AI recognize mouth shape features under different pronunciations and add more touches of verisimilitude to AI Digital Human.</li><li><strong>If the model opens the mouth without making a sound, coughs, yawns, or sneezes during shooting, the shooting should restart.</strong></li></ul> |
| Head movements | <ul><li>During shooting, the model should always face the camera lens and avoid excessive head movements in leftward or rightward directions. Only mild leftward and rightward head turns, nods, and head-raising are allowed.</li><li><strong>When the model performs a large head deflection movement, the shooting should restart.</strong></li></ul> |
| Body movements | During shooting, the model can use body movements to be livelier and more expressive. However, if any of the following rules is violated, the shooting should restart:<ul><li>The model's face should not be covered with arms.</li><li>The model's arms or other body parts should not extend beyond the camera frame.</li><li>During a rhythmic pause, the model should restore body movements to the <strong>Silent Pose</strong> and should keep this process at a moderate speed and natural to avoid too rapid a change in movement.</li><li><strong>The model should use generalized body movements and avoid movements with characteristic meanings, such as making an OK sign, making a number sign, crossing arms to make a negative sign, or pointing in a direction. </strong>Examples of prohibited body movements:<ul><li>Making an OK sign:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_OK.jpeg" /></Frame></li><li>Pointing two fingers upward:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_peace.jpeg" /></Frame></li><li>Crossing arms:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_cross.jpeg" /></Frame></li><li>Showing palm:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_five.jpeg" /></Frame></li><li>Pointing the camera lens:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_pointing_at_the_camera.jpeg" /></Frame></li><li>Pointing arms:<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/AI_Short_Video/Gesture_point.jpeg" /></Frame></li></ul></li></ul> |

#### Precautions for director

| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Natural and expressive performance by the model | <ul><li>Does the model read from the script in a fluent and natural way? If there are too many stutters, the shooting should restart after the model gets familiar with the script.</li><li>Are the model's body movements smooth? If the model's body movements are awkward, design some gestures, make the model practice enough, and then restart shooting.</li></ul> |
| Details that affect the final production effects of green screen shooting | <ul><li>If the model's clothes are made of highly reflective or translucent materials such as satin, lace, or mesh, remind them to change.</li><li>Minimize the green screen on the shooting site. For example, when the model is in a sitting position, remove the green screen beneath the model's feet to avoid green light reflected onto the model.</li><li>When the model is in a standing position, minimize the folds of the green screen on the floor by laying down transparent acrylic sheets or taping the green screen in place.</li><li>The model should be at least 2 meters away from the green screen, and the farther the better if conditions allow.</li><li>Side backlighting can eliminate the green light on the model from behind while outlining the model's silhouette.</li><li>Use F6 or smaller apertures for shooting to ensure that the model's eyes and silhouette are on the focal plane and clear and crisp. The blurring of the model's silhouette will have a great impact on later green screen removal.</li></ul> |
| Agreed gestures for reminding the model during shooting | <ul><li>Use hand signals to remind the model of the shooting duration in minutes.</li><li>Use specific gestures or a whiteboard to remind the model to restore to the Silent Pose during the first 10 minutes and last 10 minutes.</li><li>Watch out for the model's speaking habits and pause shooting in time to correct problems such as onomatopoeia, microphone popping sound, and opening the mouth but not making a sound.</li></ul> |
| The model's makeup | When the model's face becomes oily after several NG shots and the model's image in the camera starts to change, the director should cue the makeup artist. |

### 4. Submit the file

After shooting is finished, submit the video file to ZEGOCLOUD personnel, noting the brand of camera used and whether or not the log mode was used.

### Lighting solution references

Bilateral side backlighting on the model’s silhouette can be used to eliminate the green light reflected on the model when the live room has limited space (the model is no more than 4 meters away from the green screen). The main and auxiliary lights in front of the model can be adjusted according to the shooting theme.

## Audio Collection

The audio collection process consists of four steps: hardware preparation, site preparation, shooting, and file submission.

### 1. Prepare a script

The script used for audio collection must meet the following requirements:

- The script must contain over 6,000 words.

- The script content must be consistent with the application industries or scenarios of AI Digital Human.

- Write a script based on the following template. Use the right format and include pauses and reminders.

    Opening speech **(in an enthusiastic tone)**  
    Hi guys, welcome to our channel! Today in our channel we’re playing a game called Game A. There will be a lot of benefits. A quick reminder. We’ve prepared a bunch of products for group purchasing, including food, beverages, and toys. You’ll definitely be surprised!
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    The game we’re playing today is called Game A. It’s so much fun! In this game, we’re going to build our own armies to combat enemies and destroy their castle! If you have any questions, let me know in the bullet comments!   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)
    [How to play]     
    Game A is a live bullet-screen game set on a medieval fantasy continent. Participants can enter a command to join an army and then recruit soldiers and join the combat. In a battle you can send gifts to summon legions, giants, yetis, elephant soldiers, or even dragons to gain strategic advantages. The goal of this game is to destroy the enemy’s castle. The game is drawn in a fresh and beautiful cartoon art style, and provides diverse camera modes for hosts to choose from. All elements in the game including soldiers, buildings, and dragons are modeled with detailed artwork, giving players the feel of intensity and excitement of a fantastic army duel on the battlefield.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Welcome to our channel, guys! Please follow us, like us, and share our channel with your friends! Many many thanks! Special thanks to our top-tipping friend! Thank you for your gifts! I hope you guys have fun with the game and keep supporting our live game streaming.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Now, let me explain the game rules quickly. In this game we’re divided into two groups: the red army and the blue army. Each army has its own soldiers, buildings, dragons, and stuff like that. You guys can send gifts to summon legions, giants, yetis, elephant soldiers, or even dragons to gain strategic advantages for your army. Your ultimate goal is to destroy your enemy’s castle!   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Tactical strategies are very important in this game. We need to arrange and adjust our formation according to such factors as the enemy's formation and terrain. You can also combine different troop types as you like or based on your strategy. For example, you can choose troops with long-range attack abilities to protect your position and choose troops with powerful attack abilities to directly attack the enemy’s castle.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    In 2023, bullet-screen interactive games finally gained an explosive growth on the live streaming platforms in China. Since the Spring Festival of this year, the continued popularity of bullet-screen interactive games such as Game B and Game C has attracted more and more live streaming platforms and hosts to enter this field. This new form of interactive game play is highly entertaining and has strong cashability. It not only has created one after another high-income hosts but also has brought more business cooperation and cash opportunities for live streaming platforms.  
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Recently, another bullet-screen interactive game has charged into the battlefield as a breakout hit and this game is Game A. As a dark horse among bullet-screen interactive games, it quickly attracted the attention of viewers and hosts with its grand and intense battle scenes and outstanding visual performance.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Then, what exactly makes Game A a latecomer getting ahead of others?  
    This new game was launched on April 23 this year on a live streaming platform. A lot of hosts secured revenues of CNY 100,000 when they tried this game the first time. Certain hosts tried this game on their Tencent video channels and obtained revenues of CNY 200,000 on the first day and CNY 400,000 on the second day. According to insiders of Game A, the monthly revenues of this game on all platforms have exceeded CNY 60 million and, judging from the game's current popularity, will hopefully break the CNY 100 million mark next month.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    High-quality image and more diverse troop types  
    In terms of the game itself, Game A is a “red-blue duel” bullet-screen interactive game, which is currently the most popular type that focuses on large-scale camp duel. Compared with other games of the same type, Game A is set on a medieval fantasy continent and adopts a more realistic art style and high-quality rendering.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    The soldiers, buildings, and dragons in this game are all modeled with fine art, displaying high-quality images with realistic 3D visual effects while also making participants feel a stronger sense of excitement of camp confrontation as if they are standing on the battlefield watching a fantasy army duel before them. This game provides arguably far more immersive player experience than similar games and is more popular with male participants.   
    XXXX has optimal rendering effects on battlefields  
    In terms of game play, XXXX demonstrates unique strengths in multiple ways. Thanks to the R\&D team's rich experience in large-scale camp confrontation games, this game displays more troops on the screen and provides more grand and intense battle scenes, bringing players stronger excitement and aesthetic enjoyment.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Meanwhile, the game provides a rich mix of strategic troop types. Participants can send gifts to summon legions, giants, yetis, elephant soldiers, and even dragons to arrange their formation as they like or based on their strategy. This variety of troop types not only brings more strategies and changes to the battlefield, but also makes every battle full of challenges and suspense, making the game more fun and challenging to play.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    The awe-inspiring siege scenes in Game A have a high learning threshold and have gained high popularity. Thanks to its excellent quality and gameplay, Game A quickly gained widespread recognition and acclaim among hosts and participants.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    For hosts, it’s easy to learn how to play this game. Even a host who has never played any games can get up to speed quickly. This is especially beneficial to new hosts who want to quickly attract a number of followers. This is because in the live streaming process of this game, the host is more like a commentator who explains the battle situation while participants are the real players of the game.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Therefore, a host just needs to be able to read the situation and cheer on the weaker side and give strategic guidance to maintain the atmosphere of the live stream. In addition, Game A does not have high configuration requirements on the host’s computer. A GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card and an i7 processor are enough to ensure smooth live streaming of the game. Compared with other games of the same type that require at least a GeForce RTX 3070 graphics card and an i9 processor to run smoothly, Game A is very cost-effective for hosts.  
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    I see in the bullet comments that someone is asking how to download this game. Just click the little windmill icon at the bottom of the screen and you can download the game!   
    If you guys have any question or need any help in the game, just send bullet comments to let me know. I will reply as soon as possible.
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    On a live streaming platform, Game A has brought huge popularity and traffic for many hosts. For participants, this type of game is also easy to get started with. The camp confrontation mechanism of Game A allows participants to enjoy a sense of community when fighting with their companions while also experiencing the honor and pride after going through ups and downs and eventually winning the combat. Therefore, Game A is more capable of retaining users and top-tipping participants than other bullet-screen interactive games.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    More games like Game A are expected to dominate the market of bullet-screen interactive games  
    Bullet-screen interactive games are sweeping the live streaming industry in China and becoming the most sought-after type of games by hosts and participants. Compared with traditional PK battle games, high-quality bullet-screen interactive games like Game A can bring more excitement and aesthetic enjoyment to participants. While enhancing participant engagement and stickiness, this interactive mode also attracts more traffic to and increases user activity on live streaming platforms. With more and more hosts and participants joining the battlefield, Game A is expected to achieve greater success on live streaming platforms in China and promote the development of the entire bullet-screen interactive game industry.

However, it's not an easy task. In Game A, you'll experience the hardships of conquering the world.   
    During the Three Kingdoms Period, conquest is the invariable theme. In order to look down upon the world, the first thing you need to do is understand the history.

    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Part two **(this part is optional)**  
    Do you still remember Game D? What I remember most about this game is its interactive feature called the "Message Board". You can leave a message anywhere in the game, and every time a player likes your message, you'll instantly gain a few health points. It was this simple feature that created the classic battle in which the host "Xiaoxiao\_Sun Yalong” finally defeated the female warrior god with the help of 3,000 participants.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    The most important reason why this live stream became a classic case is that it was the first of its kind that used a new type of interaction between the audience and the host, which had been the biggest pain point in live game streaming for a long time.   
    In traditional live streams, there are only two kinds of interaction between the audience and the host: sending comments and giving gifts. Not only is such interaction less fulfilling, but the interaction efficiency is also very inefficient. But the story of 3,000 participants battling against the female warrior god tells a lot about the audience’s strong and universal need for interaction in live game streaming.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    If more viewers can participate in interaction to create achievements together and enjoy a sense of collective fulfillment during live streams, the rules of the entire live streaming industry will change. That brings us to our topic today: bullet-screen gameplay, a new feature that has been gradually developing on major live streaming platforms for over a year.   
    Allowing hosts' popularity and traffic to really explode, this new feature ushers in a blue ocean era for bullet-screen gameplay.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    Many events happening during this Labour Day Holiday are worth thinking about. For example, during this holiday, the spiking popularity of bullet-screen gameplay on a live streaming platform is worth the attention of the industry.   
    According to our observation of the live streaming platform, the popularity and revenues of several bullet-screen gameplay hosts during the holiday showed exponential growth while certain hosts easily doubled their achievements.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Take the entertainment host Zhang Ruohuan as an example. Her first try at live game streaming with bullet-screen gameplay sent her live stream to No.1 on the city’s live game streaming revenue list and No.2 on the national list, which proves that the cashability of bullet-screen gameplay has the potential to surpass live streaming of entertainment content. A number of new hosts such as Mengyaya, finding bullet-screen gameplay a sweet deal, have been actively prolonging their streaming time to satisfy the needs of their followers. Through their efforts, these hosts have gained influence on platforms, attracting more hosts to join the field of live game streaming with bullet-screen gameplay. It is said that on a live platform, new hosts of live game streaming with bullet-screen gameplay can easily secure revenues of over CNY 10,000 on their first day. Bullet-screen gameplay significantly shortens the time that new hosts need to break the ten thousand mark in revenues. Some hosts even gained revenues of over CNY 100,000 on their first try.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    In fact, gaming enterprises with a keen business sense have long before discovered this business logic. Many time-honored game companies have quietly started the layout of bullet-screen games, and small and medium-sized developers have already had their first bucket of gold under their belt.   
    Let’s turn back to the short video and live streaming industries. Leading live streaming platforms are also beginning to lay out their plan. Industry insiders predict that the future of bullet-screen games will usher in a massive wave of development, which may create an emerging blue ocean market worth tens of billions. So currently live streaming platforms are actively encouraging developers to cooperate with the platforms to develop new bullet-screen gameplay and jointly promote the development of the industry.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    New opportunities for small and medium-sized developers, with imagination and creativity as the biggest costs  
    From the technical aspect, the development of bullet-screen gameplay is quite simple. After talking to the team of a live streaming platform, we had a brief conversation with a developer team with rich experience. We got to know that currently the development cycle of a simple version of bullet-screen gameplay is very short. Once the plan is finalized, the gameplay can be developed within two or four weeks. The development costs are also relatively low.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    However, the costs we just mentioned refer only to the costs of technical development. According to Zhang Yang, founder of Guangzhou Yuanqi Interactive Entertainment, a company founded three years ago and dedicated to live streaming interaction products, bullet-screen gameplay development depends heavily on the imagination and creativity of planners and their understanding of the needs of audience.   
    Bullet-screen games are different from traditional games and we can even say that bullet-screen games belong to a different category. Planners of traditional games think more about how to enrich the system, while producers of bullet-screen games focus more on realizing optimal interactive experience for audience in the simplest way possible.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    Developing based on the diversified business form including short videos and live streaming platforms, bullet-screen gameplay turns the solo show of hosts into an arena where the audience directly participates in the battle by sending bullet-screen commands in real time while the host only explains the situation. Each bullet-screen command sent by the audience has an important impact on the battle.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)** 
    This mode gives the audience a strong sense of engagement and enhances the emotional connection between the audience and the host. A live streaming platform with 366 million daily active users is going to teach developers and hosts how to get started this time.
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)** 
    After doing some research on the bullet-screen gameplay of a live streaming platform, we got the host manuals of five popular bullet-screen interactive games, which are Game E, Game F, Game G, Game A, and Game H.   
    To our surprise, the manuals contain not only meticulous guidance from computer configuration, setup procedure, and game rules to operation details, but also script templates that hosts can choose from based on the characteristics of the game. The goal of the live streaming platform is simple: to help novice hosts get up to speed quickly and master the skills of warming up the atmosphere of their live streams.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    In addition, hosts on the live streaming platform have spontaneously begun to post instructional videos to teach novice hosts how to start a live stream with bullet-screen gameplay step by step, forming a complete ecological chain.   
    On the other hand, the live streaming platform is actively calling for more developers to join in and further explore more creative, personalized bullet-screen gameplay based on the characteristics of different hosts. Meanwhile, the platform hopes to optimize host and participant operations in the game so that everyone interested can get started easily.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    These actions tell us that the live streaming platform does not regard bullet-screen gameplay as a short-term dividend but seeks to establish a stable supply and demand chain of "developers-hosts-users" from scratch. The platform takes advantage of its nearly 400 million daily active users to advertise widely and attract up-stream developers and hosts, and provides them with step-by-step guidance. For downstream users, the live streaming platform provides excellent gameplay of verified quality as well as achievement mechanisms as the drive for more user engagement.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    On the whole, the live streaming platform is in its early stages with bullet-screen gameplay and is developing rapidly. Its traffic increase shows the excellent results of adopting bullet-screen gameplay. This is good news for both developers and hosts and gives them more advantages in the tacit “rat race” in the industry.   
    Real opportunities hidden under fierce competition in bullet-screen gameplay  
    The development difficulties and costs of Game E, Game F, Game G, or Game D are not high. Their success is attributed largely to their interactive design and creative ideas, which creates opportunities for small and medium-sized developer teams.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Take Game E as an example. The audience can send comments in red or blue font to join the corresponding camp and then give likes and gifts to summon various mythical beasts to attack the opposing camp. The beasts can evolve after being summoned for a number of times. All of such design can be realized by simple code and does not have high requirements for hosts and audience’s equipment. However, it brings considerable emotional value and therefore introduces endless business opportunities. Among live stream watchers are not only regular users but also marketing teams.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)** 
    Faced with such new opportunities, industry practitioners pile into the field of bullet-screen gameplay and cause an inevitably chaotic situation in the live streaming industry. Many developers think that current practitioners are obviously stuck in the “rat race” producing homogeneous gameplay with rare creativity, while live streaming platforms are adopting increasingly stringent auditing standards, which further intensifies competition in the industry. Developers are not very optimistic about the future of bullet-screen gameplay.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**
    In our opinion, this mood of pessimism is quite similar to that held by game developers because of "fierce competition in the gaming industry and difficulties of developing explosive games". Both moods of pessimism originate from the lack of in-depth thinking on product design and the speculative mindset hoping to make quick money in the blue ocean stage. However, compared with the gaming industry with a longer development history, bullet-screen gameplay has much quicker iterations, which intimidates certain developers before they actually enter the field.  
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    In fact, the development of bullet-screen gameplay has just started to boom. Essentially different from traditional games, the core of bullet-screen gameplay lies not in operations and strategies but in the host’s control of atmosphere and the audience’s participation. In other words, bullet-screen gameplay is still a variant of live streaming and social media to bring emotional values of engagement and interaction to users. The live streaming platform with 366 million users has a very keen sense of user needs and shares their rich experience with developers to help create more explosive bullet-screen gameplay.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    With this figured out, it’s easy to understand why during the Labour Day Holiday hosts on the live streaming platform gained tremendous income and popularity through bullet-screen gameplay. It’s also not hard to imagine what kind of new achievements bullet-screen gameplay can bring to hosts and live streaming platforms with further development.   
    **(2s pause, with mouth closed naturally)**  
    Closing speech  
    Further development of emerging bullet-screen gameplay undoubtedly requires the support of more creative developers. Although live streaming platforms are adopting more stringent auditing standards, the platforms are attaching greater importance to bullet-screen gameplay and providing more traffic support. For example, a live streaming platform has designed a complete process for cooperation with developers and offers a very high share of profits to developers.

## FAQ

<a id="too_loud"></a>

<Accordion title="What do I do if the speaker's volume is too high, or explosive sound exists, or large background noise exists?">
- Why situations such as explosive sound or large background noise occur may be because the recording mode of the camera is set to the automatic mode. Please adjust the audio level of the recording equipment to ensure an appropriate signal-to-noise ratio to avoid obvious background noise. If current noise exists, please contact the equipment supplier or seek help from the pre-sale service of ZEGOCLOUD.
- Keep the recording site clear of background noise, such as noise of crowds or traffic.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do if the recording volume is too low?">
Perform the following steps:

- Adjust the position of the microphone, such as clipping the collar microphone a little higher on the collar.
- Adjust the position of the recording equipment. Refer to <a href="#too_loud">What do I do if the speaker's volume is too high, or explosive sound exists, or large background noise exists?</a>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do if current noise exists in the background or along the speaker's voice?">
Current noise occurs when the connection of a 3.5 mm connection cable is loose or the recording equipment malfunctions. Please check whether the cable is inserted correctly or replace the recording equipment.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I cope with microphone popping sound?">
The main reason for the microphone popping sound is that the microphone head receives the speaker's oral airflow. You can make any of the following adjustments:

- Adjust the position of the microphone, such as clipping it on the collar.
- Adjust the angle of the microphone to avoid impact by airflow. Generally, the microphone can be placed on one side below or above the mouth and adjusted at any time during recording.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I cope with severe echoes or reverberation?">
Recording in an empty and flat room will cause severe echoes. Please record in an environment with furnishings or a corner of the room instead of at the center of the room.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I cope with dull sound or resonance with the environment?">
Sound dullness can be caused by the recording equipment or the speaker's pronunciation. If sound dullness is caused by the equipment, you are advised to use the recommended recording equipment. If sound dullness is caused by the speaker, the speaker can drink some water and record again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I cope with elision or excessively weak pronunciation of final words?">
Please make the following improvements:

- Add prompts for pauses in the script to control the speed of speech.
- The speaker pronounces words as clearly and accurately as possible.
- Considering individual speaking habits, no strict requirements are made here. Reproduction may restore the characteristics of elision and excessively weak pronunciation.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I record audio using a mobile phone?">
Recording audio by using a mobile phone is not recommended because the recording quality is relatively poor. If you need to use a mobile phone to record, it is recommended to use iPhone 12 and later models. Perform the following operations:

1. Go to Settings and choose Voice Memos > Audio Quality > Lossless.
2. Open the Voice Memos app to start recording.

<Accordion title="Can I record in several parts?">
Recording in several parts is allowed on the condition that there are no obvious differences in tone and mood among the parts. Ensure that the total duration of valid recording is at least 20 minutes.   

Recording materials with mixed moods and inconsistent tones will be determined as invalid and cannot be accepted for reproduction.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do if there is time left after the script is read?">
It is recommended to estimate the time required to read the script in advance. If the estimated time of script reading is less than 20 minutes, please prepare more content.
