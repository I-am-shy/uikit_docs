# Delete conversations

- - -

## Introduction

ZIM supports users to delete a specific conversation or all conversations in the conversation list.

## Prerequisites

Before muting a conversation, make sure:

- **Create a project** in [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com). The ZIM service permission is not enabled by default. Before using it, please activate the ZIM service by yourself in [ZEGOCLOUD Console](https://console.zegocloud.com) (for details, please refer to [Project Management - In-app Chat ](#15174)), if you cannot activate the ZIM service, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to activate it.
- Integrate the ZIM SDK. For details, see the **Integrate the SDK** chapter of [Send and receive messages](!Implementation_of_sending_and_receiving).

## Delete a conversation


To delete the specified conversation after login, call the [DeleteConversation](@DeleteConversation) with the `conversationID` parameter.

<Note title="Note">

When deleting a specified conversation:

- All messages in the conversation are not automatically deleted. If you need to delete both the conversation and all messages in the conversation, call the [DeleteConversation](@DeleteConversation) method. 
- If the conversation has unread messages, the total number of unread messages will be reduced and shown in the [OnConversationTotalUnreadMessageCountUpdated](@OnConversationTotalUnreadMessageCountUpdated) callback. For details, see the chapter **Get the number of unread messages** above.
</Note>

ZIM.GetInstance().DeleteConversation("CONV_ID", ZIMConversationType.Group, config,
    (string conversationID, ZIMConversationType conversationType,
                    ZIMError errorInfo) =>
    {
        // Result of deleting the conversation
    });
