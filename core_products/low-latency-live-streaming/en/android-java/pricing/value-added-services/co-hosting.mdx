## Usage Statistics Method

The usage of real-time audio and video services is calculated based on the actual duration of audio and video streams played by users.

- If users do not play audio streams and video streams in the room, no fees are charged.

- When a user plays an audio and video stream that contains both video stream data and audio stream data, only the video duration is calculated once, and the audio duration is not calculated repeatedly.

- When users play multiple video streams, the video duration at different resolutions is calculated separately. The resolutions of multiple video screens are not added for calculation. There will be no video tier jumping when calculating usage.

<Note title="Note">



**Precision Description:**
 - Duration usage precision is in seconds. When billing, the cumulative seconds within the billing cycle are converted to minutes for statistics. Less than one minute is counted as one minute, and fees are ultimately charged based on the number of minutes.

**Play Stream Description:**
 - Audio and video play stream refers to users obtaining "audio and video data streams" through clients (or other terminals).

 - Calculated based on the duration from when the user starts playing to when the user ends playing.

 - Billing tiers are divided based on the resolution of the audio and video streams played by users.

## Billing Examples

### Co-hosting Interactive Room

Assume that users A and B stay in the room together for 20 minutes. Neither A nor B receives video screens, and only plays the other party's **High Sound Quality Pure Audio** stream, that is, A plays B's audio stream, and B plays A's audio stream.

Fee calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Fee (CNY)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High Sound Quality Pure Audio|High quality pure audio duration unit price × Sum of high sound quality pure audio stream durations played by all users|7.00 x (20 + 20) / 1,000 |0.28|

The **total real-time audio and video fee** generated by this room is 0.28 CNY.


### Video Interactive Room

Assume that users A and B stay in the room together for 20 minutes. A only turns on the microphone, and B turns on the camera. A plays B's **Standard Definition Video (SD)** screen, and B plays A's **High Sound Quality Pure Audio**.


Fee calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Fee (CNY)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High Sound Quality Pure Audio|High quality pure audio duration unit price × Sum of high sound quality pure audio durations played by all users|7.00 × 20 / 1,000 |0.14|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|Standard Definition Video (SD) duration unit price × Sum of Standard Definition Video (SD) durations played by all users|12.00 × 20 / 1,000 |0.24|

The **total real-time audio and video fee** generated by this room = **High Sound Quality Pure Audio** fee + **Standard Definition Video (SD)** fee = 0.14 + 0.24 = 0.38 CNY.


 ### 4.3 Multi-stream Video Interactive Room

Assume that users A, B, C, D, and E stay in the room together for 20 minutes. A plays **Standard Definition Video (SD) screens** of B, C, D, and E. B, C, and D play A's **High Definition Video (HD)** screens and **Standard Definition Video (SD)** screens of the other three. E does not play any streams in the first 10 minutes, and plays A's **High Definition Video (HD)** screen and **High Sound Quality Pure Audio** of the other three in the last 10 minutes.


Play stream duration calculation:

|Billing Tier|A Play Duration (minutes)|B Play Duration (minutes)|C Play Duration (minutes)|D Play Duration (minutes)|E Play Duration (minutes)|Total Duration (minutes)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|High Sound Quality Pure Audio|0|0|0|0|10 × 3|30|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|20 × 4|20 × 3|20 × 3|20 × 3|0|260|
|High Definition Video (HD)|0|20|20|20|10|70|


Fee calculation:

|Billing Tier|Billing Formula|Calculation Example|Fee (CNY)|
|-|-|-|-|
|High Sound Quality Pure Audio|High quality pure audio duration unit price × Sum of high sound quality pure audio durations played by all users|7.00 × 30 / 1,000 |0.21|
|Standard Definition Video (SD)|Standard Definition Video (SD) duration unit price × Sum of Standard Definition Video (SD) durations played by all users|12.00 × 260 / 1,000 |3.12|
|High Definition Video (HD)|High Definition Video (HD) duration unit price × Sum of High Definition Video (HD) durations played by all users|25.00 × 70 / 1,000 | 1.75|

The **total real-time audio and video fee** generated by this room = **High Sound Quality Pure Audio** fee + **Standard Definition Video (SD)** fee + **High Definition Video (HD)** fee = 0.21 + 3.12 + 1.75 = 5.08 CNY.
