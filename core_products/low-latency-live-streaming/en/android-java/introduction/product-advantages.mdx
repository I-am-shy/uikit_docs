### Ultra-low latency

Based on a full-link self-developed UDP protocol to achieve millisecond-level latency. Compared with the 3s - 10s latency of traditional CDN live streaming, ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming enables more timely interactive feedback between hosts and viewers.

### Ultra-strong synchronization

Achieves millisecond-level synchronization with less than 400ms synchronization error between different viewers. Viewers in different regions can communicate and interact based on the same frame, easily enabling scenarios such as watch together and e-commerce flash sales.


### Extreme weak network resistance

ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming supports extreme weak network resistance, such as withstanding up to 80% packet loss without disconnection. In complex weak network environments such as overseas markets and lower-tier markets, it can still guarantee high-quality playback, effectively solving the pain points of instability in traditional CDN and other live streaming distribution products.


### Ultra-low stuttering

Compared with CDN live streaming, using ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming can reduce the stuttering rate by over 75%. Full-link monitoring of various factors affecting live streaming smoothness enables end-to-end systematic optimization from capture, encoding, publish, transmission, play, decoding, to playback. Provides globally covered stable and smooth transmission, solving the "stuttering" pain point, and keeping viewers in the live room for longer periods.


### Ultra-clear picture quality

Integrates all audio and video capabilities including ultra-low latency live streaming, real-time audio and video, and AI picture quality. Through an All-in-one SDK, it provides rich picture quality optimization capabilities, enabling users to achieve high-quality picture quality across various scenarios.

- Host-side algorithm enhancement, pursuing ultimate HD: Maximizes the advanced features of capture devices, supporting up to 4K 60fps and HDR, while using various video enhancement algorithms such as low-light enhancement and AI noise reduction to make host pictures clearer and more natural, effectively lowering the barrier to starting live streaming.
- Viewer-side intelligent adaptation, restoring HD: Implements adaptive transcoding and low-end device compatibility, breaking through limited network and device bottlenecks. Based on excellent capabilities such as AI super-resolution algorithms and H.265 encoding, it restores higher picture quality and achieves HD at low bitrates.


### Instant first frame

With 500+ available nodes globally and intelligent network scheduling algorithms, using an exclusive decoupled underlying architecture and providing instant opening strategies such as preloaded live streams, supports viewers entering rooms and switching scenes at extreme speed. Achieves an instant opening rate of over 99%, reducing the dropout rate during room entry.


### Complete features, smooth compatibility

Provides rich live streaming value-added capabilities such as stream mixing, transcoding, cloud recording, screenshots, and content moderation, supporting developers in smoothly migrating from traditional CDN live streaming.


### Seamless multi-scenario switching, burden-free integration

Compared with CDN live streaming, using ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming for playing streams enables seamless switching to RTC co-hosting. Only need to adjust one parameter to switch between hosts and viewers, supporting seamless fast switching between multiple scenarios such as live streaming and 1V1.

Provides a complete multi-person cross-room PK solution, supporting multi-room login, effectively improving live streaming PK success rates and increasing live room popularity.
