# Basic Concepts

- - -

### Publish stream

The process of pushing packaged audio and video data streams from the capture stage to the ZEGO real-time audio and video cloud.

### Play stream

The process of pulling and playing existing audio and video data streams from the ZEGO real-time audio and video cloud.

### Room

A room refers to the audio and video space service provided by ZEGO, used to organize user groups. Users in the same room can send and receive real-time audio, video, and messages to each other.
- Users need to log in to a room first before they can perform publish and play stream operations.
- Users can only receive relevant messages in their own room (user entry/exit, audio and video stream changes, etc.).

### Ultra-low latency live streaming (L3)

ZEGO's self-developed ultra-low latency live streaming is built for high-quality experience, making it a "hexagonal warrior" among live streaming distribution products. Compared with traditional CDN live streaming, ultra-low latency live streaming achieves millisecond-level latency and synchronization, with resistance to up to 80% packet loss in extreme weak networks. It also delivers experience upgrades including ultra-low stuttering, instant first frame, and ultra-clear picture quality.


### CDN live streaming

CDN live streaming provides low-cost large-scale live streaming distribution services. End-to-end latency is 3s~10s, with almost no weak network resistance.
ZEGO integrates multiple CDN vendors and provides rich on-device capabilities through an All-in-One SDK.

### Interactive co-hosting

The concept of co-hosting appears in live streaming room scenarios, including video co-hosting and voice co-hosting. It is a form of interaction between users in a room. By pushing your own stream through the [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream) interface while calling the [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStreamStream) interface to pull the other party's stream, you can implement various live streaming gameplay such as viewers joining the host for communication and interaction PK between different hosts.

ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming supports seamless switching to RTC co-hosting, enabling switching between hosts and viewers with a single parameter.

### Transcoding

Transcoding converts a single original stream into transcoded streams with different encoding formats and resolutions in the cloud. In live streaming and other scenarios, viewers can choose streams of different resolutions to watch based on network quality, terminal devices, etc., to ensure playback smoothness. For details, refer to the [Single Stream Transcoding](/live-streaming-android/live-streaming/single-stream-transcoding) document.
