    Supports padding silent frames for audio and video streams relayed to CDN, which can be used to avoid stuttering or audio-video desynchronization caused by timestamp misalignment.

3. Media player supports caching network resources locally

    Supports caching network resources locally. If you need to play the same network resource, cached data will be used first, improving user experience.

    For related APIs, please refer to [enableLocalCache](@enableLocalCache), [onMediaPlayerLocalCache](/live-streaming-electron/quick-start/setting-callback)

4. All network requests support IPv6 protocol

5. Support for hardware decoding acceleration for MJPEG format

    Note: This feature only supports pre-processing for screenshots, not other processing (such as rotation, watermark, etc.).

    When the video format output by the capture device is MJPEG, hardware decoding acceleration is enabled by default to prevent frame rate issues caused by insufficient device performance.

    This feature is mainly suitable for use with 4K resolution capture devices.

6. Media player supports callback for video resolution change events

    The media player supports throwing relevant callbacks to notify developers when it detects a change in video resolution. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the resolution of the pushed stream changes multiple times and requires adjusting the encoding resolution on the pushing side and the rendering view size on the pulling side for matching.

    For related APIs, please refer to [onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged](/live-streaming-electron/quick-start/setting-callback)

**Improvements**

1. Optimized server-side stream mixing and single stream transcoding capabilities

2. Optimized AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) algorithm for better AEC effect

3. Optimized network connection strategy to improve audio and video call experience

4. Optimized multi-device login logic

    After a user successfully logs in on device A, device A loses network; then uses the same userID to successfully log in on device B. At this point, if device A's network recovers, reconnection will fail and error code 1002086 will be thrown, indicating that this userID has logged in on another device.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed a crash issue when exiting NVIDIA hardware decoding on Windows in some cases

2. Fixed an issue with camera restart strategy when the camera is abnormal on Windows

3. Fixed an issue where the SDK could not receive network status change notifications when Windows or macOS system went to sleep, resulting in inaccurate network type determination
