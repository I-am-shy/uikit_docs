## Version 3.16.2

**Release Date: 2024-08-19**

**New Features**

1. Added Electronic Effects
    
    Electronic effects refer to the sound effects that can make people's voices or singing sound like electronic music. This feature is commonly used in KTV and voice chat room scenarios.
    
    Before initializing the SDK with [CreateEngine], you can enable electronic effects by calling the [SetElectronicEffects] interface. You can also set different modes and corresponding starting pitches for the electronic effects as needed. The electronic effects are disabled by default if this interface is not called.
    
    Developers can also use the [SetVoiceChangerPreset] interface to preset common electronic effects, including C major electronic effect, A minor electronic effect, and harmonic minor electronic effect.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [SetElectronicEffects](@SetElectronicEffects)
    
2. Added Audio Equalizer (EQ)
    
    Supports adjusting the gain values of 10 frequency bands to achieve the desired sound quality.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [SetAudioEqualizerGain](@SetAudioEqualizerGain)
    
3. Added support for setting and getting audio device volume
    
    Note: This feature is only supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
    You can set the capture volume of the audio device (speaker or microphone) using the [SetAudioDeviceVolume] interface before pushing or pulling the stream. However, due to system limitations, this interface may fail to be called. It is recommended to directly use the [SetCaptureVolume] and [SetPlayVolume] interfaces to adjust the volume of the pushed or pulled stream.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [SetAudioDeviceVolume](@SetAudioDeviceVolume), [GetAudioDeviceVolume](@GetAudioDeviceVolume), [SetCaptureVolume](@SetCaptureVolume), [SetPlayVolume](@SetPlayVolume)
    
4. Added support for monitoring audio device volume
    
    Note: This feature is only supported on Windows and macOS.
    
    You can monitor the volume of audio input or output devices.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [StartAudioDeviceVolumeMonitor](@StartAudioDeviceVolumeMonitor), [StopAudioDeviceVolumeMonitor](@StopAudioDeviceVolumeMonitor)
    
5. Added support for muting or unmuting audio devices
    
    Note: This feature is only supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
    
    You can mute or unmute audio input or output devices as needed.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [MuteAudioDevice](@MuteAudioDevice), [IsAudioDeviceMuted](@IsAudioDeviceMuted)
    
6. Added support for getting information about the currently used audio device
    
    Note: This feature is only supported on Windows and macOS.
    
    By calling the [GetCurrentAudioDevice] interface, you can get information about the currently used audio device, including the device ID and device name, reducing the development workload for developers.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [GetCurrentAudioDevice](@GetCurrentAudioDevice)
    
7. Added support for pushing static images when the camera is turned off
    
    When the camera is turned off, you can continuously push static images in JPEG/JPG, BMP, and HEIF formats. For example, when the anchor goes backstage and actively turns off the camera, the audience needs to display an image indicating that the anchor is temporarily away.
    
    After initializing the SDK, set the path of the static image to be pushed using the [SetDummyCaptureImagePath] interface before turning off the camera. When the camera is turned off using the [EnableCamera] interface during normal streaming, the static image will be pushed. When the camera is turned on using the [EnableCamera] interface, the pushing of the static image will stop.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [SetDummyCaptureImagePath](@SetDummyCaptureImagePath)
    
8. Added support for throwing exceptions callback for [SetDummyCaptureImagePath]
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [OnPublisherDummyCaptureImagePathError](@OnPublisherDummyCaptureImagePathError)
    
9. Media player supports caching network resources locally
    
    Supports caching network resources locally. If the same network resource needs to be played, the cached data will be used first to improve user experience.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [EnableLocalCache](@EnableLocalCache)
    
10. During streaming, you can control whether the stream is subject to censorship
    
    Note: If a stream is set to be subject to censorship, it will not be reviewed if the developer does not initiate a review task.
    
    When calling the censorship interface, it will review all streams in the room by default. If the client wants to control that a certain stream cannot be reviewed, the censorship flag parameter [streamCensorFlag] can be set to 1 (not allowed) when calling the [StartPublishingStream] interface to start streaming.
    
    Please refer to the related API documentation for more information: [StartPublishingStream](@StartPublishingStream), [ZegoPublisherConfig > StreamCensorFlag](@StreamCensorFlag-ZegoPublisherConfig)

**New Features**

1. Added enable or disable pull flow alignment function.
    
    This function is often used in scenes that require mixed stream alignment, such as KTV. When playing at the streaming end, use the [SetPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty] interface to control whether the real-time audio and video streams need to be accurately aligned. If necessary, all the streams that contain precise alignment parameters will be aligned; if not, all streams are not aligned.
    
    For related API, please refer to [SetPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty](@SetPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty)
    
2. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol.
    
    This feature is suitable for use on capture devices with a 4K resolution mainly.
    
3. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing.
    
    Newly added support for using live streams as input streams for mixing; the URL of the live input stream supports both RTMP and HTTP-FLV protocols. This feature is suitable for mixing the RTC video streams of hosts' interactive broadcasting with cloud sports live streams, game live streams, etc., to achieve scenarios such as game or sports commentary in live broadcasting.
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize the AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) algorithm to achieve better AEC performance.
    
2. Optimize network connection strategies to enhance the experience of audio and video calls.
    
3. Optimize the strategy of switching between the front and back end to solve the problem of collecting silence in certain specific scenarios or models on Android platform.
    
4. Optimize multi-device login logic.
    
    After the user successfully logs in on device A, device A loses network connection. Then, the user logs in successfully on device B using the same userID. If the network connection on device A is restored and a reconnection is attempted, it will fail and throw error code 1002086, indicating that the userID is already logged in another device.
