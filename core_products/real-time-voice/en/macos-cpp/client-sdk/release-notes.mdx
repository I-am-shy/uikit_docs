    Add [switchPlayingStream] interface, which is used to smoothly switch to another CDN stream when developers pull the CDN stream. That means the old stream will only be stopped after successfully pulling the new stream.
    
    For example, when the video screen switches from a small window to a large window, the video needs to be switched to a higher bitrate and resolution stream. Only after successfully pulling the new stream will the old stream be stopped, in order to achieve a smooth transition effect.
    
    For related API, please refer to [switchPlayingStream](@switchPlayingStream)
    
6. H.265 client encoding automatic compatibility strategy adds user-level negotiation range.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature.
    
    The control range of the local client encoding compatibility is either all the streaming users in the room or all users. This means that if there are users within the specified range who do not support H.265, the local client encoding will dynamically fallback.
    
    For related API, please refer to [loginRoom](@loginRoom), [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream), [ZegoPublisherConfig > codecNegotiationType](@codecNegotiationType-ZegoPublisherConfig), [ZegoRoomConfig > capabilityNegotiationTypes](@capabilityNegotiationTypes-ZegoRoomConfig)

<a name="3.13.0"></a>

## 3.13.0 Version

**Release date: 2024-03-14** 


**New Features**

1. When using the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming, it supports 0-RTT connection establishment.
    
    Note: 
    
1. The security of this feature is slightly lower compared to traditional methods. Please use it with caution. 
    
2. When using this feature, set ZegoCDNConfig.protocol to quic. 
    
    [ZegoCDNConfig] adds the [quicConnectMode] attribute, which allows developers to use the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming. Set quicConnectMode to 1 for QUIC connection mode, enabling 0-RTT connection and fast service activation. Currently compatible with CDN live streaming products from Huawei, Wangsu, Tencent, and other vendors. 
    
    This feature is not enabled by default (quicConnectMode is set to 0, indicating normal connection establishment).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoCDNConfig > quicConnectMode](@quicConnectMode-ZegoCDNConfig)
    
2. Support setting a timeout for CDN repushing to monitor the existence of a stream.
    
    Note: This feature only takes effect when initiating a retweet. If there is a disconnection during the retweet process, the SDK will maintain the retry logic and there will be no callback notification in this case. 
    
    When initiating a retweet task, you can set the timeout for the retweet CDN through the [addPublishCdnUrl] interface to monitor if the stream exists. For example, if the developer has initiated a retweet task but the stream has not started streaming yet, after the timeout set, the SDK will return a callback notification indicating that the stream does not exist. 
    
    This callback notification will only be sent to the retweet initiator, not the streaming initiator. If the retweet initiator and the streaming initiator are not the same user, it is recommended for developers to initiate the retweet from the server side and receive this notification.
    
    For related API, please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](@addPublishCdnUrl)
    
3. Support for callback local recording quality data.

    Support for copyright-music function pluginization, when the developer's business scenario only needs to update the copyright-music related, you can independently integrate the plugin without updating the Express SDK, which can smoothly migrate.
    
2. Support for getting a list of streams in the room from the client.
    
    Note: The function retrieves a real-time stream list inside the room. If the room service is disconnected, the results obtained may not be accurate. 
    
    Developers are supported to obtain the stream list inside the room from the client, which can be used to handle related business logic.
    
    For related API, please refer to [getRoomStreamList](@getRoomStreamList)
    
3. Support for adding silent frames to audio and video streams transcoded to CDN.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature. 
    
    Support is provided for adding silent frames to the audio and video streams that are pushed to the CDN. This can be used to avoid issues such as stuttering or audio-video synchronization problems caused by timestamp discrepancies.
    
4. The media player supports obtaining the real-time frame rate of the file.
    
    Support for obtaining frame rate statistical information of the currently playing media file, which can be used for data display, anomaly monitoring, etc..

## 3.11.0 Version

**Release date: 2023-11-29** 


**New Features**

1. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol.
    
2. Real-time room messaging supports sending transparent messages.
    
    Support sending real-time room messages to specified clients or client servers; message types are divided into normal and ordered, with the latter ensuring that messages are received strictly in order. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the anchor needs to manage the microphone positions in the room, for example: 
    
    - Send messages to users who need to mute through the anchor client, and the receiving client will mute accordingly. 
    
    - When the anchor wants to kick a user out of the room, send a message to the client server of the other party through the anchor client, and kick out the user.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendTransparentMessage](@sendTransparentMessage)
    
3. Automatic mixing supports setting water level.
    
    Note: 
    
1. This feature is not enabled by default, meaning the server uses the default configuration values. 
    
2. This feature may increase latency, so use it judiciously. 
    
    The automatic stream mixing interface supports setting a watermark to control the lower limit of the range for adaptive adjustment of the mixing server's stream cache. This helps maintain a balance between mixing time and video stuttering caused by unstable streaming from the source. This feature only takes effect on new input streams and does not affect input streams that have already started mixing. 
    
    For example, in a real-time karaoke KTV scenario, slight fluctuations in the streaming network from the source may cause mixing stuttering, which in turn increases the likelihood of stuttering for viewers. By adjusting the lower limit of the watermark, you can optimize the viewer's experience with stuttering, but this will increase latency.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAutoMixerTask > minPlayStreamBufferLength](@minPlayStreamBufferLength-ZegoAutoMixerTask)
    
4. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing.
    
    Newly added support for using live streams as input streams for mixing; the URL of the live input stream supports both RTMP and HTTP-FLV protocols.

## 2.8.0 Version

**Release date: 2021-06-11** 


**New Features**

1. Support login room and push stream authentication in user room.
    
    User permission control refers to the fact that when a user logs in to a room, or performs operations such as push/pull streaming in the room, the ZEGO server judges whether the user has the corresponding permission according to the Token parameter carried when the user logs in, so as to avoid the lack of permission control or Risk issues caused by improper operation. Currently, it only supports the verification of two permissions for the user to log in to the room and push streaming in the user's room.
    
    For related API, please refer to [loginRoom](@loginRoom), [renewToken](@renewToken), [onRoomTokenWillExpire](@onRoomTokenWillExpire)
    
2. Added spatial audio capabilities.
    
    The spatial audio can perceive the sound position of 360° in the space. Developers can use the spatial audio function to create a more realistic "seat" effect in the audio and video room. Users can perceive the source direction of the sound through the spatial audio and restore the offline scene. It is suitable for scenes such as language chat room, script killing and online meeting.

6. Added the support for obtaining the sound level of each input stream when playing a mixed stream.
    
    When a viewer playing a mixed stream needs to the know the sound level of each input stream, developers can call the API `enableSoundLevel` to enable sound level, and set a unique sound level ID for each input stream when starting the stream mixing task, and then the stream player can obtain the sound level of each input stream from the callback `onMixerSoundLevelUpdate`.
    
7. Added the support for sending barrage messages.
    
    When it is required to send messages to a room with more than 500 users with the assumption that the delivery of each message to each user does not need to be guaranteed (i.e., some users might miss out some messages).
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendBarrageMessage](@sendBarrageMessage)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Deprecate the `destroyEngine` interface with no parameters and add a `destroyEngine` interface with the same name but with a callback parameter.
    
    With the new API, the callback is triggered when the action of destroying the ZegoExpressEngine is completed and the resources used by the engine are released, and developers can switch to use other SDK at this point.
