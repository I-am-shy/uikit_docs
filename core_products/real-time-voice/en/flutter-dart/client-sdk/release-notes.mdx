## 3.23.0 Version

**Release date: 2025-12-18** 


**New Features**

1. onPublisherQualityUpdate callback provides traffic control status information
    
    The onPublisherQualityUpdate callback adds audioTrafficControlRate and videoTrafficControlRate fields to notify users of the current traffic control ratio.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onPublisherQualityUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onPublisherQualityUpdate.html)
    
2. switchPlayingStream supports setting timeout
    
    The switchPlayingStream interface adds the switchTimeout parameter.
    
<Note title="Note">

Assuming streams A, B, and C exist: 
- When the SDK is pulling stream A, if A switches to B and then to C, and all stream switches fail within the switchTimeout timeout, only the onPlayerSwitched callback of the last switched C will return a stream switch failure notification.
- When the SDK is pulling stream A and switches to A again, the switchTimeout parameter does not take effect, and the SDK will execute retry logic according to the stream pulling timeout. 
- When A switches to B and then back to A, and the SDK is always pulling stream A, the operation of pulling stream A will not be interrupted.

</Note>

## Version 3.13.0

**Release date: 2024-03-21** 

**New Features**

1. When using the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming, it supports 0-RTT connection establishment.
    
    Note:
    
    The security of this feature is slightly lower compared to traditional methods. Please use it with caution.
    
    When using this feature, set ZegoCDNConfig.protocol to `quic`.
    
    [ZegoCDNConfig](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoCDNConfig-class.html) adds the [quicConnectMode] attribute, which allows developers to use the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming. Set quicConnectMode to 1 for QUIC connection mode, enabling 0-RTT connection and fast service activation. Currently compatible with CDN live streaming products from Huawei, Wangsu, Tencent, and other vendors.
    
    This feature is not enabled by default (quicConnectMode is set to 0, indicating normal connection establishment).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoCDNConfig > quicConnectMode](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoCDNConfig/quicConnectMode.html)
    
2. Support setting a timeout for CDN repushing to monitor the existence of a stream.
    
    Note: This feature only takes effect when initiating a retweet. If there is a disconnection during the retweet process, the SDK will maintain the retry logic and there will be no callback notification in this case.
    
    When initiating a retweet task, you can set the timeout for the retweet CDN through the [addPublishCdnUrl](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/addPublishCdnUrl.html) interface to monitor if the stream exists. For example, if the developer has initiated a retweet task but the stream has not started streaming yet, after the timeout set, the SDK will return a callback notification indicating that the stream does not exist.
    
    This callback notification will only be sent to the retweet initiator, not the streaming initiator. If the retweet initiator and the streaming initiator are not the same user, it is recommended for developers to initiate the retweet from the server side and receive this notification.
    
    For related API, please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/addPublishCdnUrl.html)
    
3. Support for callback local recording quality data.
    
    [ZegoDataRecordProgress](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoDataRecordProgress-class.html) adds the [quality] attribute, which can be used to callback the quality data of the recorded file, such as frame rate and bit rate, during the local recording process.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate.html)
    
**Enhancements**

    Optimize the callback notification logic of the media streaming engine, add error callbacks for unsupported audio sampling rate (for example, not supporting a sampling rate of 24K), and help developers quickly locate problems.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onMediaDataPublisherFileClose](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onMediaDataPublisherFileClose.html)
    
2. For low-performance Android devices, optimize the fluency of voice and the effect of echo cancellation during background operation.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature.
    
3. For KTV scenarios, optimize the alignment effect of Bluetooth earphones on vocals and accompaniment, enhancing the K-song experience on iOS or Android platform.
    
**Bug Fixes**

1. Fix the problem of abnormal time consumption of interface calls caused by not deinitializing the SDK after long-term use.
    
2. Fixed compatibility issues with hardware encoding and decoding, addressing occasional crashes.
    
3. Fix known compatibility issues and null pointer problems.

    Note: 
    
    Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature. 
    
    The plugin cannot be used alone and must be used with Express SDK. 
    
    Support for copyright-music function pluginization, when the developer's business scenario only needs to update the copyright-music related, you can independently integrate the plugin without updating the Express SDK, which can smoothly migrate.
    
2. Support for getting a list of streams in the room from the client.
    
    Note: The function retrieves a real-time stream list inside the room. If the room service is disconnected, the results obtained may not be accurate. 
    
    Developers are supported to obtain the stream list inside the room from the client, which can be used to handle related business logic.
    
    For related API, please refer to [getRoomStreamList](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineRoom/getRoomStreamList.html)
    
3. Support for adding silent frames to audio and video streams transcoded to CDN.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature.

## Version 3.11.0 

**Release date: 2023-12-15** 

**New Features**

1. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol
    
2. Real-time room messaging supports sending transparent messages
    
    Support sending real-time room messages to specified clients or client servers; message types are divided into normal and ordered, with the latter ensuring that messages are received strictly in order. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the anchor needs to manage the microphone positions in the room, for example:
    
    - Send messages to users who need to mute through the anchor client, and the receiving client will mute accordingly.
    
    - When the anchor wants to kick a user out of the room, send a message to the client server of the other party through the anchor client, and kick out the user.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendTransparentMessage](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineIM/sendTransparentMessage.html)
    
3. Automatic mixing supports setting water level
    
    Note:
    
    - This feature is not enabled by default, meaning the server uses the default configuration values.
    
    - This feature may increase latency, so use it judiciously.
    
    The automatic stream mixing interface supports setting a watermark to control the lower limit of the range for adaptive adjustment of the mixing server's stream cache. This helps maintain a balance between mixing time and video stuttering caused by unstable streaming from the source. This feature only takes effect on new input streams and does not affect input streams that have already started mixing.
    
    For example, in a real-time karaoke KTV scenario, slight fluctuations in the streaming network from the source may cause mixing stuttering, which in turn increases the likelihood of stuttering for viewers. By adjusting the lower limit of the watermark, you can optimize the viewer's experience with stuttering, but this will increase latency.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAutoMixerTask > minPlayStreamBufferLength](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAutoMixerTask/minPlayStreamBufferLength.html)
    
4. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing
    
    Newly added support for using live streams as input streams for mixing; the URL of the live input stream supports both RTMP and HTTP-FLV protocols. This feature is suitable for mixing the RTC video streams of hosts' interactive broadcasting with cloud sports live streams, game live streams, etc., to achieve scenarios such as game or sports commentary in live broadcasting.
    
5. Custom audio offset value is supported for mixing
    
    When using custom audio and video capture function and the corresponding audio capture sources have inconsistent delays, you can customize the audio offset value during mixing to achieve audio-video synchronization after mixing output, ensuring a better experience for the audience.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerInput > advancedConfig](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerInput/advancedConfig.html)
    
6. The audio player supports separate settings for streaming volume and local volume
    
    The sound effect player supports setting the streaming volume and local playback volume separately, ensuring that the volume on both ends, local and remote, is within an appropriate range.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolume](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPublishVolume.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolume](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPlayVolume.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolumeAll](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPublishVolumeAll.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolumeAll](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPlayVolumeAll.html)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize the AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) algorithm to achieve better AEC performance
    
2. Optimize network connection strategies to enhance the experience of audio and video calls
    
3. Optimize the strategy of switching between the front and back end to solve the problem of collecting silence in certain specific scenarios or models
    
4. Optimize multi-device login logic
    
    After the user successfully logs in on device A, device A loses network connection. Then, the user logs in successfully on device B using the same userID. If the network connection on device A is restored and a reconnection is attempted, it will fail and throw error code 1002086, indicating that the userID is already logged in another device.

## Version 2.15.0

**Release date: 2021-12-15**

**New Features**


1. The Media Player supports the acquisition of sound waves and spectrum when playing music
    
    The Media Player added a sound wave spectrum callback and switch interface, which can Controller whether to enable the callback and the frequency of the callback, so as to obtain the current sound wave and spectrum of the Media Player. When playing resources through the Media Player, such as watching movies together, games and Voice Chatroom scenes, this function can be used to perform spectrum animation functions to increase the fun.
    
    After creating a Media Player, call the [enableSoundLevelMonitor] interface to Start SoundLevel Monitor. After enabling, you can use the [onMediaPlayerSoundLevelUpdate] callback to monitor sound changes.
    
    After creating a Media Player, call the [enableFrequencySpectrumMonitor] interface to enable spectrum monitoring. After enabling, you can use [onMediaPlayerSoundLevelUpdate] callback to monitor spectrum changes.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [enableSoundLevelMonitor](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMediaPlayer/enableSoundLevelMonitor.html), [onMediaPlayerSoundLevelUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onMediaPlayerSoundLevelUpdate.html), [enableFrequencySpectrumMonitor](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMediaPlayer/enableFrequencySpectrumMonitor.html), [onMediaPlayerFrequencySpectrumUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onMediaPlayerFrequencySpectrumUpdate.html)
    
    
2. Support omnidirectional Virtual Stereo
    
    Added support for omnidirectional Virtual Stereo, which simulates stereoscopic sound through algorithm processing of monophonic sound. This function is often used in KTV scenes to make the singing sound more three-dimensional.
    
    When the [enableVirtualStereo] interface is called and the angle parameter is set to -1, it means that the stereo effect is omnidirectional stereo.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [enableVirtualStereo](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/enableVirtualStereo.html)
    
    
3. Add local device exception callback [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred]
    
    Through the [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred] callback, you can set the device type to be detected, such as Camera, speaker, Microphone, etc., and the developer can handle the error callback according to different device types.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred.html)
    
    
**Enhancements**

1. Added 1015032 Error Codes
    
    Logging into the room causes the network test to stop. Since the network test will consume bandwidth, please do it before logging in to the room.
    
    
2. Added 1002066 Error Codes
    
    If the user is in the server blacklist when logging in to the room, this Error Codes will be returned, indicating that the room is prohibited from logging in.
    
    
3. Added 1004072 Error Codes
    
    When using the SDK to pull Low-Latency Live streaming, this Error Codes will be returned if you have not activated the Low-Latency Live service.
    
    
**Bug Fixes**

1. Fixed a crash when calling [startMixerTask]
    
    
**Deleted**

1. Discard [onDeviceError] callback
    
    In order to let developers intuitively understand the type of abnormal device and the specific abnormal situation, the [onDeviceError] callback is deprecated in version 2.15.0 and above, please use the [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred] callback instead.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [onDeviceError](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onDeviceError.html), [onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onLocalDeviceExceptionOccurred.html)

## Version 2.14.0

**Release date: 2021-11-30**

**New Features**


1. Added real-time ordered data function
    
    When developers need to distribute commands such as remote Controller and cloud games, they can obtain publisher messages with low latency through real-time signaling.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [createRealTimeSequentialDataManager](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineIM/createRealTimeSequentialDataManager.html)
    
    
2. Added H.265 codec exception notification
    
    Added an alarm callback for insufficient H.265 decoding performance. In the scenario of play streams through CDN, it is used to prompt the user whether to downgrade. If the developer receives the low frame rate callback [onPlayerLowFpsWarning] during the process of pulling the H.265 stream, it is recommended that the developer stop pulling the H.265 stream and switch to the H.264 stream.
    
    Added H.265 codec error prompts in the publish streams state callback [onPublisherStateUpdate] and the play streams state callback [onPlayerStateUpdate].
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [onPlayerLowFpsWarning](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onPlayerLowFpsWarning.html), [onPublisherStateUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onPublisherStateUpdate.html), [onPlayerStateUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onPlayerStateUpdate.html)
    
3. The Media Player supports specifying the start playback progress when loading media resources
    
    The [loadResourceWithPosition] interface is added to the Media Player, which supports specifying the start playback progress when loading media resources, in milliseconds.

4. Added the function of enabling or disabling play streams alignment
    
    This function is often used in KTV and other scenarios that require Stream Mixing stream alignment. When the play streams end is playing, use the [setPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty] interface to Controller whether the played real-time audio and Video streams need to be accurately aligned. If necessary, all the pulled streams that contain precise alignment parameters will be aligned; if not, all streams will be unaligned.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [setPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/setPlayStreamsAlignmentProperty.html)
    
    
5. Added steady-state voice detection function
