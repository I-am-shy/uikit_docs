## 3.13.0 Version

**Release date: 2024-03-14** 


**New Features**

1. When using the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming, it supports 0-RTT connection establishment.
    
    Note: 
    
1. The security of this feature is slightly lower compared to traditional methods. Please use it with caution. 
    
2. When using this feature, set ZegoCDNConfig.protocol to quic. 
    
    [ZegoCDNConfig] adds the [quicConnectMode] attribute, which allows developers to use the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming. Set quicConnectMode to 1 for QUIC connection mode, enabling 0-RTT connection and fast service activation. Currently compatible with CDN live streaming products from Huawei, Wangsu, Tencent, and other vendors. 
    
    This feature is not enabled by default (quicConnectMode is set to 0, indicating normal connection establishment).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoCDNConfig > quicConnectMode](@quicConnectMode-ZegoCDNConfig)
    
2. Support setting a timeout for CDN repushing to monitor the existence of a stream.
    
    Note: This feature only takes effect when initiating a retweet. If there is a disconnection during the retweet process, the SDK will maintain the retry logic and there will be no callback notification in this case. 
    
    When initiating a retweet task, you can set the timeout for the retweet CDN through the [addPublishCdnUrl] interface to monitor if the stream exists. For example, if the developer has initiated a retweet task but the stream has not started streaming yet, after the timeout set, the SDK will return a callback notification indicating that the stream does not exist. 
    
    This callback notification will only be sent to the retweet initiator, not the streaming initiator. If the retweet initiator and the streaming initiator are not the same user, it is recommended for developers to initiate the retweet from the server side and receive this notification.
    
    For related API, please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](@addPublishCdnUrl)
    
3. Support for callback local recording quality data.
    
    [ZegoDataRecordProgress] adds the [quality] attribute, which can be used to callback the quality data of the recorded file, such as frame rate and bit rate, during the local recording process.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate](@onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate)
    
4. Custom video rendering supports independent channel control.

    For related API, please refer to [enableCapturedVideoCustomVideoRender](@enableCapturedVideoCustomVideoRender), [enableRemoteVideoCustomVideoRender](@enableRemoteVideoCustomVideoRender)
    
5. Supports obtaining video data pre-processed by SDK, and passing different video data to SDK for preview and publish streaming respectively.
    
    Note: This feature may cause performance impact, please use it judiciously. 
    
    It is supported to perform other video pre-processing operations (such as beautification, etc., which need to be implemented by the developer) after obtaining the data processed by the Express SDK video, or use the processed video data directly for preview or publish.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendCustomVideoProcessedRawData](@sendCustomVideoProcessedRawData)
    
6. Support for H.265 automatic compatibility strategy.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature. 
    
    When some users in the room do not support the H.265 format, the streaming end that supports it will fall back to the H.264 format and republish stream.
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimizing the callback notification logic of the media streamer.
    
    Optimize the callback notification logic of the media streaming engine, add error callbacks for unsupported audio sampling rate (for example, not supporting a sampling rate of 24K), and help developers quickly locate problems.

## 3.11.0 Version

**Release date: 2023-11-29** 


**New Features**

1. Support high-definition and low-code video in the cloud transcoding service.
    
    Note: If you need to use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD business personnel. 
    
    By applying leading coding and decoding algorithms and other video pre-processing capabilities in the cloud transcoding service, we continuously optimize the smoothness and clarity of video playback, significantly improving the image quality. This feature is suitable for the following scenarios: 
    
    - Showroom live streaming scenes with high viewership. It ensures stable video transmission and high quality while saving bandwidth costs; without affecting the image quality, it can reduce the bitrate by about 30%. 
    
    - Danmaku game live streaming, sports live streaming, and other scenes with rich color and texture details in the video content. Under the same bitrate conditions, it can provide a higher definition viewing experience.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig > enableLowBitrateHD](@enableLowBitrateHD-ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig)
    
2. Color enhancement is supported when publishing video-streams.
    
    For various cameras and other devices that capture images, if the colors appear grayish or have low saturation, we support enhancing the colors while preserving the natural skin tones. This will make the images more vibrant and brighter, creating a more realistic visual experience for the human eye.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableColorEnhancement](@enableColorEnhancement)
    
3. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol.
    
4. Real-time room messaging supports sending transparent messages.
    
    Support sending real-time room messages to specified clients or client servers; message types are divided into normal and ordered, with the latter ensuring that messages are received strictly in order. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the anchor needs to manage the microphone positions in the room, for example: 
    
    - Send messages to users who need to mute through the anchor client, and the receiving client will mute accordingly. 
    
    - When the anchor wants to kick a user out of the room, send a message to the client server of the other party through the anchor client, and kick out the user.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendTransparentMessage](@sendTransparentMessage)
    
5. Hardware decoding acceleration supported for MJPEG format.
    
    Note: This feature only supports pre-processing of screenshots and does not support other processing such as rotation or watermarking. 
    
    When the video format output by the capture device is MJPEG, hardware decoding acceleration is enabled by default to prevent issues such as insufficient frame rate due to insufficient device performance. 
    
    This feature is suitable for use on capture devices with a 4K resolution mainly.
    
6. Automatic mixing supports setting water level.
    
    Note: 
    
1. This feature is not enabled by default, meaning the server uses the default configuration values. 
    
2. This feature may increase latency, so use it judiciously. 
    
    The automatic stream mixing interface supports setting a watermark to control the lower limit of the range for adaptive adjustment of the mixing server's stream cache. This helps maintain a balance between mixing time and video stuttering caused by unstable streaming from the source. This feature only takes effect on new input streams and does not affect input streams that have already started mixing. 
    
    For example, in a real-time karaoke KTV scenario, slight fluctuations in the streaming network from the source may cause mixing stuttering, which in turn increases the likelihood of stuttering for viewers. By adjusting the lower limit of the watermark, you can optimize the viewer's experience with stuttering, but this will increase latency.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAutoMixerTask > minPlayStreamBufferLength](@minPlayStreamBufferLength-ZegoAutoMixerTask)
    
7. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing.

This feature is suitable for mixing the RTC video streams of hosts' interactive broadcasting with cloud sports live streams, game live streams, etc., to achieve scenarios such as game or sports commentary in live broadcasting.
    
8. Custom audio offset value is supported for mixing.
    
    When using custom audio and video capture function and the corresponding audio capture sources have inconsistent delays, you can customize the audio offset value during mixing to achieve audio-video synchronization after mixing output, ensuring a better experience for the audience. 
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerInput > advancedConfig](@advancedConfig-ZegoMixerInput)
    
9. The media player supports callbacks for video resolution change events.
    
    The media player supports throwing relevant callback notifications to developers when the video resolution changes. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the resolution of the streaming screen changes multiple times and requires adjusting the encoding resolution on the streaming end and matching the rendering view size on the receiving end.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged](@onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged)
    
10. The audio player supports separate settings for streaming volume and local volume.
    
    The sound effect player supports setting the streaming volume and local playback volume separately, ensuring that the volume on both ends, local and remote, is within an appropriate range.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolume](@setPublishVolume-IZegoAudioEffectPlayer), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolume](@setPlayVolume-IZegoAudioEffectPlayer), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolumeAll](@setPublishVolumeAll-IZegoAudioEffectPlayer), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolumeAll](@setPlayVolumeAll-IZegoAudioEffectPlayer)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize server-side mixing and single-stream transcoding capabilities.
    
    Optimize server-side mix streaming and single-stream transcoding capabilities to improve encoding efficiency and achieve a 5% or more increase in subjective and objective video quality at the same bitrate.

## 2.21.0 Version

**Release date: 2022-07-08** 


**New Features**

1. Range voice supports custom distance update frequency.
    
    The default distance update frequency of the SDK is changed from 1s to 100ms, which can basically meet the smooth attenuation effect for most developers when using range voice, optimize the experience of sound attenuation when using range voice, and achieve a smoother and more natural attenuation effect.
    
    If you want to better match the actual business demand, you can call the [setPositionUpdateFrequency] interface to modify the frequency by yourself.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoRangeAudio > setPositionUpdateFrequency](@setPositionUpdateFrequency-IZegoRangeAudio)
    
2. Support setting the low-light enhancement.
    
    Note: The [setLowlightEnhancement] interface should be called after calling the [createEngine] interface to create an engine.
    
    When the surrounding environment of the stream-publishing user is dark, or the frame rate set by the camera is high, resulting in a dark live broadcast screen, and the subject cannot be displayed or recognized normally, you can call the [setLowlightEnhancement] interface to set the low-light enhancement to increase the brightness of the video screen. The low-light enhancement function includes three modes: 1: Disable the low-light enhancement (default), 2: Enable the low-light enhancement, 3: Automatically switch on/off the low-light enhancement.
    
    You can choose different low-light enhancement modes according to business scenarios: when you want to judge whether the low-light enhancement is needed, you can switch between modes 1 and 2; when you want the SDK to automatically enhance the brightness, you can enable the mode 3, and the SDK will automatically determine the lighting environment where the user is in, and turn on or off the low-light enhancement.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLowlightEnhancement](@setLowlightEnhancement)
    
3. Support setting video borders to rounded corners when mixing streams.
    
    When calling the [startMixerTask] interface to mix streams, you can set the [cornerRadius] through the [ZegoMixerInput] class to turn the video border to rounded corners. The unit of [cornerRadius] is px, and the value cannot exceed the half of the width or the height of video screen, which is shorter.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startMixerTask](@startMixerTask)
    
4. Add the CDN Plus playing configuration to the startPlayingStream interface.
    
    Note: If you want to control the stream-playing mode from the cloud by more criteria such as region and user, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for related configuration.
    
    The [ZegoStreamResourceMode] interface adds CDN_PLUS as a new ZegoResourceType. interface. You can enable CDN_PLUS to play stream by yourself based on to the stream critirion. The CDN Plus stream-playing is a cost-effective method, because its quality is higher than CDN stream-playing with similar price.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize the related error codes of Token exceptions when mandatory login authentication is enabled.

    After calling the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine and the [createMediaPlayer] interface to create a media player, you can call the [setActiveAudioChannel] interface to set the left channel, right channel or all channels. When initialized, the media player defaults to all channels.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setActiveAudioChannel](@setActiveAudioChannel)
    
2. Media player supports clearing the last frame when the playback ends.
    
    Note: You must wait for the media player to finish playing before the API call takes effect.
    
    Call the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine, call the [createMediaPlayer] interface to create a media player, and call [clearView] to clear the last remaining frame.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMediaPlayer > clearView](@clearView-IZegoMediaPlayer)
    
3. Support the camera to automatically change the frame rate.
    
    Note: When the frame rate set by [setVideoConfig] is less than the minimum expected frame rate of [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS], the frame rate value set by [setVideoConfig] will be used. Due to the different hardware and algorithm strategies of different mobile phone manufacturers, the effect of this interface is different on different models or on the front and back cameras of the same model.
    
    When the frame rate set by the user on the streaming end is high, and the ambient light is low and the subject cannot be displayed or recognized normally, you can call the [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS] interface to automatically reduce the frame rate within a certain range to increase exposure time, so as to improve the brightness of the video picture. This function is often used in live broadcast scenes with high exposure requirements. The [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS] interface needs to be called after calling the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine and before starting the camera.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS](@enableCameraAdaptiveFPS)
    
4. Support setting the picture information of a single input stream in the mixed stream.
    
    Note: The length of the image address must not exceed 1024 bytes, otherwise the error code 1005034 will appear; the image format should be JPG and PNG format, otherwise the error code 1005035 will appear; the image must not exceed 1M, otherwise the error code 1005036 will appear.
    
    You can set the image address through the [ZegoMixerImageInfo] type parameter of the [startMixerTask] interface to set the content of a single input stream as an image, which is used to replace the video, that is, when the image is used, the video is not displayed. This function is mainly used in a video call when a video caller may need to temporarily turn off the camera to display the image, or in a call between a video caller and a voice caller when the image of the voice caller may need to be displayed.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startMixerTask](@startMixerTask)
    
5. Support setting whether to clear the last frame after calling the mutePlayStreamVideo interface.
    
    NOTE: To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support.
    
    When you finds that the stream publisher violates the regulations, you can call the [mutePlayStreamVideo] interface to discontinue the stream puller from pulling the video stream of the violating user, and request the violating user to make corrections. Using this function at the same time can avoid the risk of violation caused by the video interface of the stream puller still retaining the last frame.
    
6. Supports linearly increasing volume gain.
    
    NOTE: To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support.
    
    A new volume gain method is provided, and you can choose an appropriate volume gain method according to actual needs.
    
7. Supports automatic censorship of audio and video at the stream level.

**Enhancements**

1. Optimized the multi-room function.
    
    The same user can join multiple rooms at the same time, and in multiple rooms at the same time (currently the default is up to 5 rooms at the same time) push, pull, send real-time messages, and receive message callbacks. This function can isolate the messages and callbacks of multiple rooms, and realize more flexible mic-linking services. ZEGO is recommended for super small class scenes with inter-room interconnection and online education.
    
    You need to call [ZegoRoomMode] to set the multi-room mode before initializing the SDK, and then call the [loginRoom] interface to log in to the multi-room.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setRoomMode](@setRoomMode), [loginRoom](@loginRoom)
    
2. Optimized the logic of exiting the room.

## 2.6.0 Version

**Release date: 2021-04-15** 


**New Features**

1. Added focus voice feature in mix stream.
    
    In the case of mixed streaming, the developer sets the target stream that needs to be highlighted on the streaming end, so as to highlight the voice of a specific user in a noisy environment where multiple people are talking at the same time. For example, in a meeting scenario, the voice of key people can be guaranteed. When calling the [startMixerTask] interface to start mixing, first set the [mixMode] in the incoming [ZegoMixerAudioConfig] mixed audio configuration parameter to [focused], and configure the [isAudioFocus] of [ZegoMixerInput] in the stream that needs to be highlighted. If it is [true], the stream can be designated as the focus voice stream.

## 2.3.0 Version

**Release date: 2021-03-04** 


**New Features**

1. Added a interface for setting log attributes.
    
    When developers need to customize the log file size and path, they can call the [setLogConfig] interface to complete the configuration, and it must be set before calling [createEngine] to take effect. If set after [createEngine], it will take effect at the next [createEngine] after [destroyEngine]. Once the [setLogConfig] interface is called, before [destroyEngine], that is, during the entire life cycle of the engine, the old way of setting the log size and path through [setEngineConfig] will be invalid. It is recommended that once you use this interface, you always only use it to complete the requirements for setting the log path and size.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLogConfig](@setLogConfig)
    
2. Added [setApiCalledCallback] interface, used to set the callback of the execution result of the calling method.

    For related API, please refer to [setApiCalledCallback](@setApiCalledCallback)
    
3. Added [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface, used to set the playback video stream type.
    
    When the pusher has set the [codecID] to [SVC] through [setVideoConfig] (it can be set before and after the pull), the puller can dynamically set and select different stream types (small resolution is the two-division of the standard layer) one). When the network is weak or the rendered UI window is small, you can choose to use a small resolution video to save bandwidth.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType)
    
4. Added [setAllPlayStreamVolume] interface to set the volume of all streaming sounds.

**Bug Fixes**

1. Fix the problem of abnormal audio device mode switching.
    
**Deleted**

1. Deprecated [setPlayStreamVideoLayer] interface.
    
    Because the view type parameters that are more general and easier to understand are defined, the new interface itself can clearly describe the concept of playing streams and switching between large and small streams, so as to avoid misunderstandings for developers, the [setPlayStreamVideoLayer] interface is abandoned in 2.3.0 and above, and the [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface is used instead.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType)
    
2. In order to reflect the timing requirements and functional independence of setting the Log property in the SDK, and to avoid misuse by developers, therefore the [logConfig] property of the [ZegoEngineConfig] class is discarded, and the [setLogConfig] interface is added to implement the original function.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLogConfig](@setLogConfig)
    
3. Deprecated the [setDebugVerbose] interface, please use the [setEngineConfig] function to set the advanced property [advancedConfig] to achieve the original function.

1. Deleted [customVideoCaptureMainConfig] and [customVideoCaptureAuxConfig] in [ZegoEngineConfig], please use [enableCustomVideoCapture] function in [ZegoExpressEngine] instead.
    
    The legacy function follows the life cycle of [setEngineConfig] function and is not flexible enough. After allowing the setting of [custom video capture] before the engine is started, Express SDK has added an independent [enableCustomVideoCapture] function to set the custom video capture.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCustomVideoCapture](@enableCustomVideoCapture)
    
2. Deleted [customVideoRenderConfig] in [ZegoEngineConfig], please use [enableCustomVideoRender] function in [ZegoExpressEngine] instead.
    
    The legacy function follows the life cycle of [setEngineConfig] and is not flexible enough. After allowing the setting of [custom video render] before the engine is started, Express SDK has added an independent [enableCustomVideoRender] function to set the custom video render.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCustomVideoRender](@enableCustomVideoRender)
    
3. Deleted [destroyEngine()] function, please use [destroyEngine(callback)] instead.
    
    Added a new destroy engine function with the [callback] parameter. If the developer needs to switch between multiple audio/video SDK, the ZEGO SDK can be assumed to have freed up the device's hardware resources when the callback is received. If there is no need to listen, just set null for the [callback] parameter.
    
    For related API, please refer to [destroyEngine](@destroyEngine)
    
4. Deleted [onRemoteAudioData] callback, please use [onPlaybackAudioData] instead.

    For related API, please refer to [onPlaybackAudioData](@onPlaybackAudioData)
    
5. Deleted [muteAudioOutput], please use [muteSpeaker] instead.
    
    The naming style and semantics of the legacy function are not clear. [muteSpeaker] uses the definition of Speaker to correspond to the Microphone.
    
    For related API, please refer to [muteSpeaker](@muteSpeaker)
    
6. Deleted [createMediaPlayer] function in [ZegoMediaPlayer] class, please use [createMediaPlayer] in [ZegoExpressEngine] class instead.
    
    The life cycle of the media player follows the engine, so it is changed to the instance method of the same name of [ZegoExpressEngine] class.
    
    For related API, please refer to [createMediaPlayer](@createMediaPlayer)
    
7. Delete [volume] and [getVolume] in [ZegoMediaPlayer], please use [setPublishVolume], [getPublishVolume], [setPlayVolume], [getPlayVolume] instead.
    
    The engine provides the function of separately acquiring the player's publish volume and local playback volume, accurate volume acquisition, so the original unified acquisition interface is deprecated.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMediaPlayer > setPublishVolume](@setPublishVolume-IZegoMediaPlayer), [ZegoMediaPlayer > setPlayVolume](@setPlayVolume-IZegoMediaPlayer)

## 1.6.0 Version

**Release date: 2020-04-15** 


**New Features**

1. Added some new properties for callback `onPublisherQualityUpdate`, through which developers can obtain the following information to perform statistics on the data related to stream publishing. `totalSendBytes`, the total bytes sent. `audioSendBytes`, number of bytes of audio data sent. `videoSendBytes`, number of bytes of video data sent.
    
2. Added some new properties for callback `onPublisherQualityUpdate`, through which developers can obtain the following information to perform statistics on the data related to stream playing and the latency of stream playing. `totalSendBytes`, the total bytes sent. `audioSendBytes`, number of bytes of audio data sent. `videoSendBytes`, number of bytes of video data sent.

<a name="1.5.0"></a>

## 1.5.0 Version

**Release date: 2020-03-14** 


**New Features**

1. Added scenario pre-configuration properties.
    
    Developers can select scenario when calling `createEngine`, and the SDK will perform optimal pre-configuration for real-time communication scenarios and live broadcast scenarios.
    
2. Added the support for publishing the auxiliary stream.
    
    This feature can be used when developers need to publish one stream with source video from the camera and the other stream with source video from the screen. It can be applied to many scenarios, such as online education and video conferencing.
    
3. Added the support for setting the codecID for video encoding.
    
    When calling the API `setVideoConfig` to set up the video configurations for stream publishing, developers can set the video codecID to multi layer to enable multi-bitrate encoding.
    
4. Added the support for stream publishing traffic control.
    
    Developers can call the API `enableTrafficControl:property:` to enable this feature and choose one or more of the following traffic control properties, to adjust the video bitrate (the basic property), to adjust the video frame rate, to adjust the video resolution.
    
5. Added the support for direct streaming to CDN with `enablePublishDirectToCDN`.
    
    Developers can directly push audio/video streams to CDN from the client by specifying the CDN URL or using the related ZEGO backend configuration before start publishing.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enablePublishDirectToCDN](@enablePublishDirectToCDN)
    
6. Added advanced stream playing configurations with a new overloading API of `startPlayingStream`.
    
    When streams are directly published or relayed to CDN, they have to be played via URL. Developers can set up the CDN configurations for playing streams via URL. When multi-bitrate encoding is enabled on the stream publishing side, the stream player can play the stream with the lower resolution by setting the videoLayer to base.
    
7. Added the support for obtaining the sound level of each input stream when playing a mixed stream.
    
    When a viewer playing a mixed stream needs to the know the sound level of each input stream, developers can call the API `enableSoundLevel` to enable sound level, and set a unique sound level ID for each input stream when starting the stream mixing task, and then the stream player can obtain the sound level of each input stream from the callback `onMixerSoundLevelUpdate`.
    
8. Added the support for sending barrage messages.
    
    When it is required to send messages to a room with more than 500 users with the assumption that the delivery of each message to each user does not need to be guaranteed (i.e., some users might miss out some messages).
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendBarrageMessage](@sendBarrageMessage)
    
9. Added built-in preview rendering for custom video capture.
    
    With this feature, developers do not have to render the preview by themselves when using custom video capture.
    
**Enhancements**

1. Deprecate the `destroyEngine` interface with no parameters and add a `destroyEngine` interface with the same name but with a callback parameter.
    
    With the new API, the callback is triggered when the action of destroying the ZegoExpressEngine is completed and the resources used by the engine are released, and developers can switch to use other SDK at this point.
