## 3.23.0 Version

**Release date: 2025-12-18** 


**New Features**

1. onPublisherQualityUpdate callback provides traffic control status information
    
    The onPublisherQualityUpdate callback adds audioTrafficControlRate and videoTrafficControlRate fields to notify users of the current traffic control ratio.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onPublisherQualityUpdate](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onPublisherQualityUpdate.html)
    
    
2. setDummyCaptureImagePath supports passing network image addresses
    
    For related API, please refer to [setDummyCaptureImagePath](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/setDummyCaptureImagePath.html)
    
    
3. switchPlayingStream supports setting timeout
    
    The switchPlayingStream interface adds the switchTimeout parameter.
    
<Note title="Note">

Assuming streams A, B, and C exist: 
- When the SDK is pulling stream A, if A switches to B and then to C, and all stream switches fail within the switchTimeout timeout, only the onPlayerSwitched callback of the last switched C will return a stream switch failure notification.
- When the SDK is pulling stream A and switches to A again, the switchTimeout parameter does not take effect, and the SDK will execute retry logic according to the stream pulling timeout. 
- When A switches to B and then back to A, and the SDK is always pulling stream A, the operation of pulling stream A will not be interrupted.

</Note>

    Note:
    
    - Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to enable this feature.
    - Configure the video super-resolution before initialization.
    
    When the video resolution exceeds the device's maximum supported limit, additional damage will be introduced, resulting in a decrease in video quality. Therefore, the video super-resolution capability adds support for 1.33x and 1.5x zoom factors to adapt to the best effect on different devices.
    
5. Low-latency mode added to AI noise reduction
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to enable this feature.
    
    Under a 10ms delay, the AI noise reduction can still maintain pure noise reduction effect and high-fidelity voice quality. It is suitable for scenarios that are sensitive to latency, such as In-Game Voice Chat, Party up in games, and real-time chorus. Currently, AI noise reduction supports balanced mode, low-latency mode, and lightweight mode.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setANSMode](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/setANSMode.html)
    
6. Control whether a stream is subject to review during streaming
    
    Note: If a stream is set to allow review, it will not be reviewed if the developer does not initiate a review task.
    
    When calling the review interface, it will review all streams in the room by default. If the client wants to control that a certain stream cannot be reviewed, it can set the review flag [streamCensorFlag] parameter to 1 (not allowed) when calling the [startPublishingStream] interface to start streaming.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPublishingStream](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/startPublishingStream.html), [ZegoPublisherConfig > streamCensorFlag](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoPublisherConfig/streamCensorFlag.html)

**New Features**

1. Added video stabilization feature (Only supports iOS).
    
    Note:
    
    This feature is only available for use during internal video capture.
    
    When this feature is enabled, there may be delays or cropping of the image, so please use it accordingly.
    
    The new video stabilization feature is added to reduce the impact of camera shake during internal video capture and improve the quality of video capture.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setCameraStabilizationMode](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/setCameraStabilizationMode.html)
    
2. When using the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming, it supports 0-RTT connection establishment.
    
    Note:
    
    The security of this feature is slightly lower compared to traditional methods. Please use it with caution.
    
    When using this feature, set ZegoCDNConfig.protocol to `quic`.
    
    [ZegoCDNConfig](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoCDNConfig-class.html) adds the [quicConnectMode] attribute, which allows developers to use the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming. Set quicConnectMode to 1 for QUIC connection mode, enabling 0-RTT connection and fast service activation. Currently compatible with CDN live streaming products from Huawei, Wangsu, Tencent, and other vendors.
    
    This feature is not enabled by default (quicConnectMode is set to 0, indicating normal connection establishment).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoCDNConfig > quicConnectMode](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoCDNConfig/quicConnectMode.html)
    
3. Support setting a timeout for CDN repushing to monitor the existence of a stream.
    
    Note: This feature only takes effect when initiating a retweet. If there is a disconnection during the retweet process, the SDK will maintain the retry logic and there will be no callback notification in this case.
    
    When initiating a retweet task, you can set the timeout for the retweet CDN through the [addPublishCdnUrl](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/addPublishCdnUrl.html) interface to monitor if the stream exists. For example, if the developer has initiated a retweet task but the stream has not started streaming yet, after the timeout set, the SDK will return a callback notification indicating that the stream does not exist.
    
    This callback notification will only be sent to the retweet initiator, not the streaming initiator. If the retweet initiator and the streaming initiator are not the same user, it is recommended for developers to initiate the retweet from the server side and receive this notification.
    
    For related API, please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/addPublishCdnUrl.html)
    
4. Support for callback local recording quality data.
    
    [ZegoDataRecordProgress](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoDataRecordProgress-class.html) adds the [quality] attribute, which can be used to callback the quality data of the recorded file, such as frame rate and bit rate, during the local recording process.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate.html)

## Version 3.11.0 

**Release date: 2023-12-15** 

**New Features**

1. Support high-definition and low-code video in the cloud transcoding service
    
    Note: If you need to use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD business personnel.
    
    By applying leading coding and decoding algorithms and other video pre-processing capabilities in the cloud transcoding service, we continuously optimize the smoothness and clarity of video playback, significantly improving the image quality. This feature is suitable for the following scenarios:
    
    - Showroom live streaming scenes with high viewership. It ensures stable video transmission and high quality while saving bandwidth costs; without affecting the image quality, it can reduce the bitrate by about 30%.
    
    - Danmaku game live streaming, sports live streaming, and other scenes with rich color and texture details in the video content. Under the same bitrate conditions, it can provide a higher definition viewing experience.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig > enableLowBitrateHD](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig/enableLowBitrateHD.html)
    
2. Color enhancement is supported when publishing video-streams
    
    For various cameras and other devices that capture images, if the colors appear grayish or have low saturation, we support enhancing the colors while preserving the natural skin tones. This will make the images more vibrant and brighter, creating a more realistic visual experience for the human eye.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableColorEnhancement](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePreprocess/enableColorEnhancement.html)
    
3. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol
    
4. Real-time room messaging supports sending transparent messages
    
    Support sending real-time room messages to specified clients or client servers; message types are divided into normal and ordered, with the latter ensuring that messages are received strictly in order. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the anchor needs to manage the microphone positions in the room, for example:
    
    - Send messages to users who need to mute through the anchor client, and the receiving client will mute accordingly.
    
    - When the anchor wants to kick a user out of the room, send a message to the client server of the other party through the anchor client, and kick out the user.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendTransparentMessage](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngineIM/sendTransparentMessage.html)
    
5. Hardware decoding acceleration supported for MJPEG format
    
    Note: This feature only supports pre-processing of screenshots and does not support other processing such as rotation or watermarking.
    
    When the video format output by the capture device is MJPEG, hardware decoding acceleration is enabled by default to prevent issues such as insufficient frame rate due to insufficient device performance.
    
    This feature is suitable for use on capture devices with a 4K resolution mainly.
    
6. Automatic mixing supports setting water level
    
    Note:
    
    - This feature is not enabled by default, meaning the server uses the default configuration values.
    
    - This feature may increase latency, so use it judiciously.
    
    The automatic stream mixing interface supports setting a watermark to control the lower limit of the range for adaptive adjustment of the mixing server's stream cache. This helps maintain a balance between mixing time and video stuttering caused by unstable streaming from the source. This feature only takes effect on new input streams and does not affect input streams that have already started mixing.
    
    For example, in a real-time karaoke KTV scenario, slight fluctuations in the streaming network from the source may cause mixing stuttering, which in turn increases the likelihood of stuttering for viewers. By adjusting the lower limit of the watermark, you can optimize the viewer's experience with stuttering, but this will increase latency.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAutoMixerTask > minPlayStreamBufferLength](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAutoMixerTask/minPlayStreamBufferLength.html)
    
7. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing
    
    Newly added support for using live streams as input streams for mixing; the URL of the live input stream supports both RTMP and HTTP-FLV protocols. This feature is suitable for mixing the RTC video streams of hosts' interactive broadcasting with cloud sports live streams, game live streams, etc., to achieve scenarios such as game or sports commentary in live broadcasting.
    
8. Custom audio offset value is supported for mixing
    
    When using custom audio and video capture function and the corresponding audio capture sources have inconsistent delays, you can customize the audio offset value during mixing to achieve audio-video synchronization after mixing output, ensuring a better experience for the audience.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerInput > advancedConfig](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoMixerInput/advancedConfig.html)
    
9. The media player supports callbacks for video resolution change events
    
    The media player supports throwing relevant callback notifications to developers when the video resolution changes. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the resolution of the streaming screen changes multiple times and requires adjusting the encoding resolution on the streaming end and matching the rendering view size on the receiving end.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEngine/onMediaPlayerVideoSizeChanged.html)
    
10. The audio player supports separate settings for streaming volume and local volume
    
    The sound effect player supports setting the streaming volume and local playback volume separately, ensuring that the volume on both ends, local and remote, is within an appropriate range.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolume](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPublishVolume.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolume](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPlayVolume.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPublishVolumeAll](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPublishVolumeAll.html), [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlayVolumeAll](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoAudioEffectPlayer/setPlayVolumeAll.html)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize server-side mixing and single-stream transcoding capabilities
    
    Optimize server-side mix streaming and single-stream transcoding capabilities to improve encoding efficiency and achieve a 5% or more increase in subjective and objective video quality at the same bitrate.
    
2. Optimize the AEC (Acoustic Echo Cancellation) algorithm to achieve better AEC performance
    
3. Optimize network connection strategies to enhance the experience of audio and video calls
    
4. Optimize the strategy of switching between the front and back end to solve the problem of collecting silence in certain specific scenarios or models
    
5. Optimize multi-device login logic
    
    After the user successfully logs in on device A, device A loses network connection. Then, the user logs in successfully on device B using the same userID. If the network connection on device A is restored and a reconnection is attempted, it will fail and throw error code 1002086, indicating that the userID is already logged in another device.

## Version 3.3.0

**Release date: 2023-03-20**


**New Features**

1. Support the vocal enhancement effect in the external playback scene
    
    In the external playback scene, the Microphone of the device is too close to the speaker, which may easily cause the human voice to be blurred or dull. In this scenario, vocal enhancement can effectively improve the clarity of vocals and improve the dullness, so it is recommended to enable this function in the loudspeaker scenario.
    
    In order to achieve the human voice enhancement effect in the external playback scene, you can turn on the human voice enhancement AudioEffect and set the enhancement level. The recommended enhancement level is 4, which can be used in the KTV external playback scene to finely Controller the vocal effect.

The return value is changed to an int type; 0 means not supported, and this encoding format cannot be used for publish streams; 1 means supported, and this encoding format can be used for publish streams; 2 means not confirmed, and it is recommended to call this interface later. This feature currently only supports Android、iOS、macOS and Windows platforms.
    
    The SDK supports obtaining the support status of the codec mode of the specified Encoding & Decoding of the current device, so as to better help developers choose the codec and encoding mode to use and obtain better results.
    
    - Through the [isVideoEncoderSupported](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/isVideoEncoderSupported.html) interface, the hardware or software encoding support of the current encoder can be obtained.
    - Through the [isVideoDecoderSupported](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/isVideoDecoderSupported.html) interface, the hardware or software decoding support of the current decoder can be obtained. Both of the above two interfaces contain three enumerated values: support hardware or software, support hardware, and support software.
    
    For example, ZegoExpressEngine.instance.isVideoEncoderSupported(ZegoVideoCodecID.H265, codecBackend: ZegoVideoCodecBackend.Hardware) means checking whether the current device supports H265 hard encoding, and returns 1 if it does.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [isVideoEncoderSupported](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePublisher/isVideoEncoderSupported.html), [isVideoDecoderSupported](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/isVideoDecoderSupported.html)

## Version 2.19.0

**Release date: 2022.05.23**


**New Features**

1. Direct publishing to CDN stream supports play streams through L3
    
    When Direct publishing to CDN , the SDK play streams from the customer's CDN source site, distributes the audio and Video content to the audience through L3, and Controller the source site resources through [ZegoResourceType] without changing the publish streams method. This function is often used in live broadcast scenarios.
    
    For related APIs, please refer to [startPlayingStream](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/dart_flutter/zego_express_engine/ZegoExpressEnginePlayer/startPlayingStream.html)
    
2. Support SEI data synchronization with Audio frame in audio and Video scenarios
    
    Note: Currently, only the RTC scenario is supported, and it is invalid in the Direct publishing to CDN and Relaying Streams to CDNs scenarios.
    
    Starting from version 2.19.0, SEI (Media Supplemental Enhancement Information) is supported to be sent synchronously with Audio frames in audio and Video scenarios. This function is often used in Video scenarios where SEI is strongly related to Audio , such as real-time KTV.
    
    In versions prior to 2.19.0, the SEI data was sent along with the Video frame data. Generally, the FPS is much lower than the Audio frame rate, resulting in insufficient SEI accuracy/frequency in Stream Mixing stream alignment and accompaniment alignment scenarios.
