## 3.16.0 Version

**Release date: 2024-07-26** 


**New Features**

1. Support simultaneous video capture from front and rear cameras.
    
    Note: 
    
    - This feature is only available for iOS 13 and above. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to enable this feature.
    
    - This feature consumes a lot of phone performance, please use it with caution.
    
    - Developers can use the interface of [AVCaptureMultiCamSession.multiCamSupported] in the system library to determine if the simultaneous use of front and rear cameras is supported.
    
    The new enumeration value `ZegoVideoSourceTypeSecondaryCamera` is added to identify the video from the second camera. You can use the [setVideoSource] interface to push the videos from the two cameras separately. You can use [useFrontCamera] to switch between the front and rear views corresponding to `ZegoVideoSourceTypeCamera` and `ZegoVideoSourceTypeSecondaryCamera`. This capability can be applied to scenarios such as dual-camera live broadcasting.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setVideoSource](@setVideoSource), [useFrontCamera](@useFrontCamera), [ZegoVideoSourceType > ZegoVideoSourceTypeSecondaryCamera](@ZegoVideoSourceTypeSecondaryCamera-ZegoVideoSourceType), [ZegoVideoSourceType > ZegoVideoSourceTypeCamera](@ZegoVideoSourceTypeCamera-ZegoVideoSourceType)
    
2. For mobile phones with 3 rear cameras, automatically select the clearest camera for video capture
    
    Note:
    
    - This feature is only available for iOS 14 and above. Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you wish to use this feature.
    
    - You can use the system interface [AVCaptureDeviceDiscoverySession] to determine in advance whether the device supports 3 rear cameras.
    
    When the device has 3 rear cameras (ultra-wide, main, and telephoto), after enabling the relevant configuration, if you update the zoom factor through [setCameraZoomFactor], the SDK will automatically select the clearest camera for video capture based on the zoom factor.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setCameraZoomFactor](@setCameraZoomFactor)
    
3. Video super-resolution supports magnification factors of 1.33x and 1.5x
    
    Note:
    
    - Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you wish to use this feature.
    
    - Configure before initializing video super-resolution.
    
    Higher video resolution than the device's supported limit can introduce additional damage, leading to a decrease in video quality. Therefore, the video super-resolution capability has added magnification factors of 1.33x and 1.5x to adapt to the best effect on different devices. 
    
4. AI noise reduction adds a low-latency mode
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you wish to use this feature.
    
    Maintaining a pure noise reduction effect and high-fidelity human voice quality at a 10ms delay, suitable for scenarios such as In-Game Voice Chat, Party up in games, and real-time singing that are sensitive to latency. Currently, AI noise reduction supports balanced mode, low-latency mode, and lightweight mode. 
    
    For related API, please refer to [setANSMode](@setANSMode)
    
5. When publishing streams, you can control whether the stream is allowed for review
    
    Note: If a stream is set to allow review, it will not be submitted for review if the developer does not initiate a review task.
    
    When calling the review interface, it will review all streams in the room by default. If the client wants to control that a certain stream should not be submitted for review, the review flag [streamCensorFlag] parameter can be set to 1 (not allowed) when calling the [startPublishingStream] interface to start pushing the stream.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream), [ZegoPublisherConfig > streamCensorFlag](@streamCensorFlag-ZegoPublisherConfig)
    
6. Media Player supports playback speed as low as 0.3x.
    
    Media Player playback speed range of the layer has been expanded from [0.5, 4.0] to [0.3, 4.0].
    
    For related API, please refer to [setPlaySpeed](@setPlaySpeed)
    
7. Support for adaptive bitrate playback is available when streaming through L3.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for using this feature.
    
    When using ZEGO ultra-low latency live streaming (L3) for playback, it supports smooth switching between different bitrates based on the user's network bandwidth, ensuring a smooth playback experience.
    
    [ZegoPlayerConfig] Added `adaptiveSwitch` and `adaptiveTemplateIDList` parameters to support bitrate adaptive switching based on the network environment in OnlyL3 playback mode.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream), [adaptiveSwitch](@adaptiveSwitch), [adaptiveTemplateIDList](@adaptiveTemplateIDList)
    
8. Support smooth switching when using CDN for streaming
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for using this feature.
    
    Add [switchPlayingStream] interface, which is used to smoothly switch to another CDN stream when developers pull the CDN stream. That means the old stream will only be stopped after successfully pulling the new stream.
    
    For example, when the video screen switches from a small window to a large window, the video needs to be switched to a higher bitrate and resolution stream. Only after successfully pulling the new stream will the old stream be stopped, in order to achieve a smooth transition effect.
    
    For related API, please refer to [switchPlayingStream](@switchPlayingStream)
    
9. H.265 client encoding automatic compatibility strategy adds user-level negotiation range.
    
    Note: Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support if you need to use this feature.
    
    The control range of the local client encoding compatibility is either all the streaming users in the room or all users. This means that if there are users within the specified range who do not support H.265, the local client encoding will dynamically fallback.
    
    For related API, please refer to [loginRoom](@loginRoom), [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream), [ZegoPublisherConfig > codecNegotiationType](@codecNegotiationType-ZegoPublisherConfig), [ZegoRoomConfig > capabilityNegotiationTypes](@capabilityNegotiationTypes-ZegoRoomConfig)

**New Features**

1. Added video stabilization feature.
    
    Note: 
    
    - This feature is only available for use during internal video capture. 
    
    - When this feature is enabled, there may be delays or cropping of the image, so please use it accordingly. 
    
    The new video stabilization feature is added to reduce the impact of camera shake during internal video capture and improve the quality of video capture.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setCameraStabilizationMode](@setCameraStabilizationMode)
    
2. When using the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming, it supports 0-RTT connection establishment.
    
    Note: 
    
1. The security of this feature is slightly lower compared to traditional methods. Please use it with caution. 
    
2. When using this feature, set ZegoCDNConfig.protocol to quic. 
    
    [ZegoCDNConfig] adds the [quicConnectMode] attribute, which allows developers to use the QUIC protocol for CDN streaming. Set quicConnectMode to 1 for QUIC connection mode, enabling 0-RTT connection and fast service activation. Currently compatible with CDN live streaming products from Huawei, Wangsu, Tencent, and other vendors. 
    
    This feature is not enabled by default (quicConnectMode is set to 0, indicating normal connection establishment).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoCDNConfig > quicConnectMode](@quicConnectMode-ZegoCDNConfig)
    
3. Support setting a timeout for CDN repushing to monitor the existence of a stream.
    
    Note: This feature only takes effect when initiating a retweet. If there is a disconnection during the retweet process, the SDK will maintain the retry logic and there will be no callback notification in this case. 
    
    When initiating a retweet task, you can set the timeout for the retweet CDN through the [addPublishCdnUrl] interface to monitor if the stream exists. For example, if the developer has initiated a retweet task but the stream has not started streaming yet, after the timeout set, the SDK will return a callback notification indicating that the stream does not exist. 
    
    This callback notification will only be sent to the retweet initiator, not the streaming initiator. If the retweet initiator and the streaming initiator are not the same user, it is recommended for developers to initiate the retweet from the server side and receive this notification.
    
    For related API, please refer to [addPublishCdnUrl](@addPublishCdnUrl)
    
4. Support for callback local recording quality data.
    
    [ZegoDataRecordProgress] adds the [quality] attribute, which can be used to callback the quality data of the recorded file, such as frame rate and bit rate, during the local recording process.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate](@onCapturedDataRecordProgressUpdate)
    
5. Custom video rendering supports independent channel control.
    
    Custom video rendering supports independent channel control. For example, for a specified stream ID, only SDK internal rendering is performed without executing custom rendering.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCapturedVideoCustomVideoRender](@enableCapturedVideoCustomVideoRender), [enableRemoteVideoCustomVideoRender](@enableRemoteVideoCustomVideoRender)
    
6. Supports obtaining video data pre-processed by SDK, and passing different video data to SDK for preview and publish streaming respectively.
    
    Note: 
    
    - This feature may cause performance impact, please use it judiciously. 
    
    - Developers need to manage the CVPixelBuffer data returned by the SDK interface through CVPixelBufferPool. 
    
    It is supported to perform other video pre-processing operations (such as beautification, etc., which need to be implemented by the developer) after obtaining the data processed by the Express SDK video, or use the processed video data directly for preview or publish.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendCustomVideoProcessedCVPixelBuffer](@sendCustomVideoProcessedCVPixelBuffer)
    
7. Supports low-light enhancement and color enhancement when using external capturing.
    
    Note: The external capture function and pre-processing function cannot be used at the same time, otherwise abnormal images may occur when playing streams. 
    
    After enabling the external capture function, you can use the [setLowlightEnhancement] and [enableColorEnhancement] interfaces to separately enable low-light enhancement and color enhancement to adjust the captured images according to your business needs.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLowlightEnhancement](@setLowlightEnhancement), [enableColorEnhancement](@enableColorEnhancement)

## 3.11.0 Version

**Release date: 2023-11-29** 


**New Features**

1. Support high-definition and low-code video in the cloud transcoding service.
    
    Note: If you need to use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD business personnel. 
    
    By applying leading coding and decoding algorithms and other video pre-processing capabilities in the cloud transcoding service, we continuously optimize the smoothness and clarity of video playback, significantly improving the image quality. This feature is suitable for the following scenarios: 
    
    - Showroom live streaming scenes with high viewership. It ensures stable video transmission and high quality while saving bandwidth costs; without affecting the image quality, it can reduce the bitrate by about 30%. 
    
    - Danmaku game live streaming, sports live streaming, and other scenes with rich color and texture details in the video content. Under the same bitrate conditions, it can provide a higher definition viewing experience.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig > enableLowBitrateHD](@enableLowBitrateHD-ZegoMixerOutputVideoConfig)
    
2. Color enhancement is supported when publishing video-streams.
    
    For various cameras and other devices that capture images, if the colors appear grayish or have low saturation, we support enhancing the colors while preserving the natural skin tones. This will make the images more vibrant and brighter, creating a more realistic visual experience for the human eye.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableColorEnhancement](@enableColorEnhancement)
    
3. All network requests support the IPv6 protocol.
    
4. Real-time room messaging supports sending transparent messages.
    
    Support sending real-time room messages to specified clients or client servers; message types are divided into normal and ordered, with the latter ensuring that messages are received strictly in order. This feature is suitable for scenarios where the anchor needs to manage the microphone positions in the room, for example: 
    
    - Send messages to users who need to mute through the anchor client, and the receiving client will mute accordingly. 
    
    - When the anchor wants to kick a user out of the room, send a message to the client server of the other party through the anchor client, and kick out the user.
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendTransparentMessage](@sendTransparentMessage)
    
5. Hardware decoding acceleration supported for MJPEG format.
    
    Note: This feature only supports pre-processing of screenshots and does not support other processing such as rotation or watermarking. 
    
    When the video format output by the capture device is MJPEG, hardware decoding acceleration is enabled by default to prevent issues such as insufficient frame rate due to insufficient device performance. 
    
    This feature is suitable for use on capture devices with a 4K resolution mainly.
    
6. Automatic mixing supports setting water level.
    
    Note: 
    
1. This feature is not enabled by default, meaning the server uses the default configuration values. 
    
2. This feature may increase latency, so use it judiciously. 
    
    The automatic stream mixing interface supports setting a watermark to control the lower limit of the range for adaptive adjustment of the mixing server's stream cache. This helps maintain a balance between mixing time and video stuttering caused by unstable streaming from the source. This feature only takes effect on new input streams and does not affect input streams that have already started mixing. 
    
    For example, in a real-time karaoke KTV scenario, slight fluctuations in the streaming network from the source may cause mixing stuttering, which in turn increases the likelihood of stuttering for viewers. By adjusting the lower limit of the watermark, you can optimize the viewer's experience with stuttering, but this will increase latency.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAutoMixerTask > minPlayStreamBufferLength](@minPlayStreamBufferLength-ZegoAutoMixerTask)
    
7. Support for using live streams as input streams for mixing.
    
    Newly added support for using live streams as input streams for mixing; the URL of the live input stream supports both RTMP and HTTP-FLV protocols. This feature is suitable for mixing the RTC video streams of hosts' interactive broadcasting with cloud sports live streams, game live streams, etc., to achieve scenarios such as game or sports commentary in live broadcasting.
    
8. Custom audio offset value is supported for mixing.
    
    When using custom audio and video capture function and the corresponding audio capture sources have inconsistent delays, you can customize the audio offset value during mixing to achieve audio-video synchronization after mixing output, ensuring a better experience for the audience. 
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMixerInput > advancedConfig](@advancedConfig-ZegoMixerInput)

## 2.21.0 Version

**Release date: 2022-07-08** 


**New Features**

1. Range voice supports custom distance update frequency.
    
    The default distance update frequency of the SDK is changed from 1s to 100ms, which can basically meet the smooth attenuation effect for most developers when using range voice, optimize the experience of sound attenuation when using range voice, and achieve a smoother and more natural attenuation effect.
    
    If you want to better match the actual business demand, you can call the [setPositionUpdateFrequency] interface to modify the frequency by yourself.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoRangeAudio > setPositionUpdateFrequency](@setPositionUpdateFrequency-ZegoRangeAudio)
    
2. Support setting the low-light enhancement.
    
    Note: The [setLowlightEnhancement] interface should be called after calling the [createEngine] interface to create an engine.
    
    When the surrounding environment of the stream-publishing user is dark, or the frame rate set by the camera is high, resulting in a dark live broadcast screen, and the subject cannot be displayed or recognized normally, you can call the [setLowlightEnhancement] interface to set the low-light enhancement to increase the brightness of the video screen. The low-light enhancement function includes three modes: 1: Disable the low-light enhancement (default), 2: Enable the low-light enhancement, 3: Automatically switch on/off the low-light enhancement.
    
    You can choose different low-light enhancement modes according to business scenarios: when you want to judge whether the low-light enhancement is needed, you can switch between modes 1 and 2; when you want the SDK to automatically enhance the brightness, you can enable the mode 3, and the SDK will automatically determine the lighting environment where the user is in, and turn on or off the low-light enhancement.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLowlightEnhancement](@setLowlightEnhancement)
    
3. Support setting video borders to rounded corners when mixing streams.
    
    When calling the [startMixerTask] interface to mix streams, you can set the [cornerRadius] through the [ZegoMixerInput] class to turn the video border to rounded corners. The unit of [cornerRadius] is px, and the value cannot exceed the half of the width or the height of video screen, which is shorter.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startMixerTask](@startMixerTask)
    
4. Add the CDN Plus playing configuration to the startPlayingStream interface.
    
    Note: If you want to control the stream-playing mode from the cloud by more criteria such as region and user, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for related configuration.
    
    The [ZegoStreamResourceMode] interface adds CDN_PLUS as a new ZegoResourceType. interface. You can enable CDN_PLUS to play stream by yourself based on to the stream critirion. The CDN Plus stream-playing is a cost-effective method, because its quality is higher than CDN stream-playing with similar price.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Optimize the related error codes of Token exceptions when mandatory login authentication is enabled.
    
    Added 1002074, 1002075, 1002076, 1002077, 1002078, 1002079, 1002080 and other error codes. After enabling mandatory login authentication, if the Token is incorrect, these error codes will be returned.

## 2.20.0 Version

**Release date: 2022-06-09** 


**New Features**

1. Media player supports setting the channel.
    
    After calling the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine and the [createMediaPlayer] interface to create a media player, you can call the [setActiveAudioChannel] interface to set the left channel, right channel or all channels. When initialized, the media player defaults to all channels.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setActiveAudioChannel](@setActiveAudioChannel)
    
2. Media player supports clearing the last frame when the playback ends.
    
    Note: You must wait for the media player to finish playing before the API call takes effect.
    
    Call the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine, call the [createMediaPlayer] interface to create a media player, and call [clearView] to clear the last remaining frame.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMediaPlayer > clearView](@clearView-ZegoMediaPlayer)
    
3. Support the camera to automatically change the frame rate.
    
    Note: When the frame rate set by [setVideoConfig] is less than the minimum expected frame rate of [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS], the frame rate value set by [setVideoConfig] will be used. Due to the different hardware and algorithm strategies of different mobile phone manufacturers, the effect of this interface is different on different models or on the front and back cameras of the same model.
    
    When the frame rate set by the user on the streaming end is high, and the ambient light is low and the subject cannot be displayed or recognized normally, you can call the [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS] interface to automatically reduce the frame rate within a certain range to increase exposure time, so as to improve the brightness of the video picture. This function is often used in live broadcast scenes with high exposure requirements. The [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS] interface needs to be called after calling the [createEngine] interface to initialize the engine and before starting the camera.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCameraAdaptiveFPS](@enableCameraAdaptiveFPS)
    
4. Support setting the picture information of a single input stream in the mixed stream.
    
    Note: The length of the image address must not exceed 1024 bytes, otherwise the error code 1005034 will appear; the image format should be JPG and PNG format, otherwise the error code 1005035 will appear; the image must not exceed 1M, otherwise the error code 1005036 will appear.
    
    You can set the image address through the [ZegoMixerImageInfo] type parameter of the [startMixerTask] interface to set the content of a single input stream as an image, which is used to replace the video, that is, when the image is used, the video is not displayed. This function is mainly used in a video call when a video caller may need to temporarily turn off the camera to display the image, or in a call between a video caller and a voice caller when the image of the voice caller may need to be displayed.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startMixerTask](@startMixerTask)
    
5. Support setting whether to clear the last frame after calling the mutePlayStreamVideo interface.
    
    NOTE: To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support.
    
    When you finds that the stream publisher violates the regulations, you can call the [mutePlayStreamVideo] interface to discontinue the stream puller from pulling the video stream of the violating user, and request the violating user to make corrections. Using this function at the same time can avoid the risk of violation caused by the video interface of the stream puller still retaining the last frame.
    
6. Supports linearly increasing volume gain.
    
    NOTE: To use this feature, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support.
    
    A new volume gain method is provided, and you can choose an appropriate volume gain method according to actual needs.
    
7. Supports automatic censorship of audio and video at the stream level.
    
    Note: To use this function, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to activate the background service.
    
    When calling the [startPublishingStream] API to start streaming, you can set the [ZegoStreamCensorshipMode] parameter to conduct automatic audio and video censorship at the stream level, and automatically identify sensitive content, thus reducing the integration difficulty and business maintenance costs.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPublishingStream](@startPublishingStream)
    
**Enhancements**

1. Unifies the APIs of Express-Video SDK and Express-Audio SDK.
    
    From v2.20.0, there is no longer any API difference between Express-Video SDK and Express-Audio SDK, that is, you can easily switch from Video SDK to Audio SDK and vice versa at any time. The only difference between the two SDKs is that for the Audio SDK, some video-related APIs (such as video encoding parameter settings, ZegoCanvas parameter in startPlayingStream, etc.) have no effect after being set, and no error will be reported. After upgrading from the old version, it may cause few incompatibilities and need to be fixed. Please refer to the FAQ <a href="https://docs.zegocloud.com/faq/express_v2.20.0_upgrade_notice_en?product=ExpressVideo&platform=all" target="_blank" rel=" noopener noreferrer">How to solve the compilation error after upgrading to Express v2.20.0 or above?</a>.
    
2. The error code when the developer passes in a non-existing AppID has been optimized from 1002099 to 1001004.
    
3. The echo cancellation has been optimized to solve the swallowed sound phenomenon in KTV and other scenarios.
    
4. Added 1009013 error code.
    
    It indicates that the message input length exceeds the limit. When this error code appears, please check the input content length or contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to extend the message content length.
    
5. Added 1017009 error code.
    
    When the copyrighted music is initialized, the authentication fails because the AppSign or Token is not set, and this error code will appear. At this time, if you use AppSign for authentication, please fill in AppSign when initializing the SDK; if you use Token authentication, before calling the [initCopyrightedMusic] interface, please call the [loginRoom] interface and pass in Token for authentication.
    
    For related API, please refer to [initCopyrightedMusic](@initCopyrightedMusic), [loginRoom](@loginRoom)

## 2.19.0 Version

**Release date: 2022-05-11** 


**New Features**

1. Direct push CDN streams support pulling streams through L3.
    
    When pushing CDN directly, without changing the push mode, the SDK pulls the stream from the customer's CDN source site, distributes the audio and video content to the audience through L3, and controls the source site resources through [ZegoResourceType]. This function is often used in live broadcast scenarios.
    
    For related API, please refer to [startPlayingStream](@startPlayingStream)
    
2. Support SEI data synchronization with audio frame in audio and video scenarios.
    
    Note: Currently, only RTC scenarios are supported, and it is invalid in direct CDN and retweet CDN scenarios.
    
    Starting from version 2.19.0, SEI (Media Supplemental Enhancement Information) can be sent synchronously with audio frames in audio and video scenarios. This function is often used in video scenarios where SEI is strongly related to audio, such as real-time KTV.
    
    In versions before 2.19.0, the SEI data was sent along with the video frame data. Generally, the video frame rate is much lower than the audio frame rate, resulting in insufficient SEI accuracy/frequency in mixed stream alignment and accompaniment alignment scenarios.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onPlayerRecvAudioSideInfo](@onPlayerRecvAudioSideInfo), [sendAudioSideInfo](@sendAudioSideInfo)

    After playing the sound effect, you can call the [setPlaySpeed] API in [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer] class to set four playback speeds for the sound effect (the local playback speed and the streaming speed will be set at the same time), which are 0.5x, 1.0x, 1.5x and 2x respectively, and the default is the original speed (1.0x).
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoAudioEffectPlayer > setPlaySpeed](@setPlaySpeed-ZegoAudioEffectPlayer)
    
3. Supports push-pull streaming using QUIC protocol during CDN live streaming.
    
    The QUIC protocol push-pull streaming is mainly used to improve the unstable quality of CDN live streaming in a weak network environment, but the improvement is limited. It is recommended to use low-latency live streaming to enjoy high-quality and low-latency live streaming services. Currently, QUIC protocol push and pull streaming using Tencent and Wangsu's two CDN live streaming products are supported.
    
    Configure the push protocol and QUIC version through the [ZegoCDNConfig] parameter in the [enablePublishDirectToCDN] interface. If you want to perform custom CDN streaming of the QUIC protocol, you need to configure the pull protocol through the [ZegoPlayerConfig] parameter in [startPlayingStream] and the QUIC version.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enablePublishDirectToCDN](@enablePublishDirectToCDN)
    
4. Address and protocol-related information that supports monitoring of push-pull streams.

<a name="2.3.0"></a>

## 2.3.0 Version

**Release date: 2021-03-04** 


**New Features**

1. Added a interface for setting log attributes.
    
    When developers need to customize the log file size and path, they can call the [setLogConfig] interface to complete the configuration, and it must be set before calling [createEngine] to take effect. If set after [createEngine], it will take effect at the next [createEngine] after [destroyEngine]. Once the [setLogConfig] interface is called, before [destroyEngine], that is, during the entire life cycle of the engine, the old way of setting the log size and path through [setEngineConfig] will be invalid. It is recommended that once you use this interface, you always only use it to complete the requirements for setting the log path and size.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLogConfig](@setLogConfig)
    
2. Added [setApiCalledCallback] interface, used to set the callback of the execution result of the calling method.

    For related API, please refer to [setApiCalledCallback](@setApiCalledCallback)
    
3. Added [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface, used to set the playback video stream type.
    
    When the pusher has set the [codecID] to [SVC] through [setVideoConfig] (it can be set before and after the pull), the puller can dynamically set and select different stream types (small resolution is the two-division of the standard layer) one). When the network is weak or the rendered UI window is small, you can choose to use a small resolution video to save bandwidth.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType)
    
4. Added [setAudioRouteToSpeaker] interface for setting audio routing to speakers.
    
    Via [setAudioRouteToSpeaker], you can set the audio route to the speaker. When you choose not to use the built-in speaker to play the sound, that is, when it is set to [false], the SDK will select the audio output device with the highest current priority to play the sound according to the system schedule.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setAudioRouteToSpeaker](@setAudioRouteToSpeaker)
    
5. Added [setAllPlayStreamVolume] interface to set the volume of all streaming sounds.

1. Fix the problem of abnormal audio device mode switching.
    
**Deleted**

1. Deprecated [setPlayStreamVideoLayer] interface.
    
    Because the view type parameters that are more general and easier to understand are defined, the new interface itself can clearly describe the concept of playing streams and switching between large and small streams, so as to avoid misunderstandings for developers, the [setPlayStreamVideoLayer] interface is abandoned in 2.3.0 and above, and the [setPlayStreamVideoType] interface is used instead.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setPlayStreamVideoType](@setPlayStreamVideoType)
    
2. In order to reflect the timing requirements and functional independence of setting the Log property in the SDK, and to avoid misuse by developers, therefore the [logConfig] property of the [ZegoEngineConfig] class is discarded, and the [setLogConfig] interface is added to implement the original function.
    
    For related API, please refer to [setLogConfig](@setLogConfig)
    
3. Deprecated the [setDebugVerbose] interface, please use the [setEngineConfig] function to set the advanced property [advancedConfig] to achieve the original function.

    The legacy function follows the life cycle of [setEngineConfig] function and is not flexible enough. After allowing the setting of [custom video capture] before the engine is started, Express SDK has added an independent [enableCustomVideoCapture] function to set the custom video capture.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCustomVideoCapture](@enableCustomVideoCapture)
    
2. Deleted [customVideoRenderConfig] in [ZegoEngineConfig], please use [enableCustomVideoRender] function in [ZegoExpressEngine] instead.
    
    The legacy function follows the life cycle of [setEngineConfig] and is not flexible enough. After allowing the setting of [custom video render] before the engine is started, Express SDK has added an independent [enableCustomVideoRender] function to set the custom video render.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enableCustomVideoRender](@enableCustomVideoRender)
    
3. Deleted [destroyEngine()] function, please use [destroyEngine(callback)] instead.
    
    Added a new destroy engine function with the [callback] parameter. If the developer needs to switch between multiple audio/video SDK, the ZEGO SDK can be assumed to have freed up the device's hardware resources when the callback is received. If there is no need to listen, just set null for the [callback] parameter.
    
    For related API, please refer to [destroyEngine](@destroyEngine)
    
4. Deleted [onRemoteAudioData] callback, please use [onPlaybackAudioData] instead.
    
    The name of the legacy callback does not match the actual function, so delete and rename.
    
    For related API, please refer to [onPlaybackAudioData](@onPlaybackAudioData)
    
5. Deleted [muteAudioOutput], please use [muteSpeaker] instead.
    
    The naming style and semantics of the legacy function are not clear. [muteSpeaker] uses the definition of Speaker to correspond to the Microphone.
    
    For related API, please refer to [muteSpeaker](@muteSpeaker)
    
6. Deleted [createMediaPlayer] function in [ZegoMediaPlayer] class, please use [createMediaPlayer] in [ZegoExpressEngine] class instead.
    
    The life cycle of the media player follows the engine, so it is changed to the instance method of the same name of [ZegoExpressEngine] class.
    
    For related API, please refer to [createMediaPlayer](@createMediaPlayer)
    
7. Delete [volume] and [getVolume] in [ZegoMediaPlayer], please use [setPublishVolume], [getPublishVolume], [setPlayVolume], [getPlayVolume] instead.
    
    The engine provides the function of separately acquiring the player's publish volume and local playback volume, accurate volume acquisition, so the original unified acquisition interface is deprecated.
    
    For related API, please refer to [ZegoMediaPlayer > setPublishVolume](@setPublishVolume-ZegoMediaPlayer), [ZegoMediaPlayer > setPlayVolume](@setPlayVolume-ZegoMediaPlayer)

## 1.5.0 Version

**Release date: 2020-03-14** 


**New Features**

1. Added scenario pre-configuration properties.
    
    Developers can select scenario when calling `createEngine`, and the SDK will perform optimal pre-configuration for real-time communication scenarios and live broadcast scenarios.
    
2. Added the support for publishing the auxiliary stream.
    
    This feature can be used when developers need to publish one stream with source video from the camera and the other stream with source video from the screen. It can be applied to many scenarios, such as online education and video conferencing.
    
3. Added the support for setting the codecID for video encoding.
    
    When calling the API `setVideoConfig` to set up the video configurations for stream publishing, developers can set the video codecID to multi layer to enable multi-bitrate encoding.
    
4. Added the support for stream publishing traffic control.
    
    Developers can call the API `enableTrafficControl:property:` to enable this feature and choose one or more of the following traffic control properties, to adjust the video bitrate (the basic property), to adjust the video frame rate, to adjust the video resolution.
    
5. Added the support for direct streaming to CDN with `enablePublishDirectToCDN`.
    
    Developers can directly push audio/video streams to CDN from the client by specifying the CDN URL or using the related ZEGO backend configuration before start publishing.
    
    For related API, please refer to [enablePublishDirectToCDN](@enablePublishDirectToCDN)
    
6. Added advanced stream playing configurations with a new overloading API of `startPlayingStream`.
    
    When streams are directly published or relayed to CDN, they have to be played via URL. Developers can set up the CDN configurations for playing streams via URL. When multi-bitrate encoding is enabled on the stream publishing side, the stream player can play the stream with the lower resolution by setting the videoLayer to base.
    
7. Added the support for obtaining the sound level of each input stream when playing a mixed stream.
    
    When a viewer playing a mixed stream needs to the know the sound level of each input stream, developers can call the API `enableSoundLevel` to enable sound level, and set a unique sound level ID for each input stream when starting the stream mixing task, and then the stream player can obtain the sound level of each input stream from the callback `onMixerSoundLevelUpdate`.
    
8. Added the support for sending barrage messages.
    
    When it is required to send messages to a room with more than 500 users with the assumption that the delivery of each message to each user does not need to be guaranteed (i.e., some users might miss out some messages).
    
    For related API, please refer to [sendBarrageMessage](@sendBarrageMessage)
    
9. Added built-in preview rendering for custom video capture.
    
    With this feature, developers do not have to render the preview by themselves when using custom video capture.
    
**Enhancements**

1. Deprecate the `destroyEngine` interface with no parameters and add a `destroyEngine` interface with the same name but with a callback parameter.
    
    With the new API, the callback is triggered when the action of destroying the ZegoExpressEngine is completed and the resources used by the engine are released, and developers can switch to use other SDK at this point.
