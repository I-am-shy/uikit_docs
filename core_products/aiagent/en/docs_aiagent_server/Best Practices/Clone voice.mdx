# Clone Voice for AI Agent

During real-time voice interaction with an AI agent, you can switch the agent's voice to a desired voice, such as a user's voice. By recording just a few seconds of the target person's voice, you can instantly replicate their voice timbre, speaking style, accent, and acoustic environment.

Voice cloning is a value-added capability. For pricing details, please refer to: [TTS Pricing](./../Introduction/Pricing.mdx#tts-text-to-speech).

<Note title="Note">Currently supports voice cloning and text-to-speech capabilities from multiple vendors including Volcengine, MiniMax, and Alibaba.</Note>

## Prerequisites

<Step title="Use cloned voice in voice conversations">
When registering an AI agent ([RegisterAgent](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Configuration%20Management/Register%20Agent.mdx)) or creating an agent instance ([CreateAgentInstance](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Management/Create%20Agent%20instance.mdx)), set the Params field in the TTS structure. This field will be passed through to the third-party TTS interface, including voice information:

- MiniMax: Fill in voice_id
- Volcengine: Fill in speaker_id
