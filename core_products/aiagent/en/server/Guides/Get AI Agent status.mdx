# Get AI Agent Status

During real-time voice calls with AI Agents, you might need to know the AI agent instance's current status or receive real-time updates to handle subsequent operations or maintain system stability. You can get these updates through API requests or by listening to server callbacks.

The status messages include the following types:
- Server exception events: including AI Agent service errors, RTC errors, Large Language Model (LLM) errors, Text-to-Speech (TTS) errors (such as TTS concurrency limit reached), etc.
- AI agent instance status:
    - Status that can be queried via server API: idle, listening, thinking, speaking, etc.
    - Status that can be monitored via server callbacks: agent interruption events, which can be used to terminate ongoing tasks such as RAG tasks.

## Listen for Server Exception Events

Contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to configure the callback address for receiving AI Agent backend callbacks.

When there are exception events on the server, the AI Agent backend will send an exception event notification (`Event` is `Exception`) to the configured address. Here's a callback content sample:

```json {3}
{
    "AppId": 123456789,
    "Event": "Exception",
    "Nonce": "abcdd22113",
    "Timestamp":1741221508000,
    "Signature": "XXXXXXX",
    "Sequence": 1921825797275873300,
    "RoomId": "test_room",
    "AgentUserId": "test_agent",
    "AgentInstanceId": "1912124734317838336",
    "Data": {
        "Code": 2203,
        "Message": "The API key in the request is missing or invalid"
    }
}
```
For more detailed information, please refer to the [Receiving Callback](./../Callbacks/Receiving%20Callback.mdx) and [Exception Codes](./../Callbacks/Exception%20codes.mdx) documentation.

## Get Agent Instance Status

### Via Server API

Call the [QueryAgentInstanceStatus](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Control/Query%20Agent%20instance%20status.mdx) API and pass in the corresponding `AgentInstanceId`. The server will return the current status of the AI agent instance (such as idle, listening, thinking, speaking, etc.).

<Note title="Note">You can obtain the `AgentInstanceId` from the successful response returned by the CreateAgentInstance call.</Note>

### Listen for Agent Interruption Callbacks

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure callback address">
Contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to configure the callback address for receiving AI Agent backend callbacks.
</Step>
<Step title="Enable callback reception">
When [creating an agent instance](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Management/Create%20Agent%20instance.mdx), set the request parameter `CallbackConfig.Interrupted` to 1.
</Step>
<Step title="Receive callbacks">
When the AI agent is interrupted, the AI Agent backend will send an interruption event notification (`Event` is `Interrupted`) to the configured address. Here's an example of the content:
```json {7}
{
    "AppId": 123456789,
    "Nonce": "abcdd22113",
    "Timestamp": 1747033950524ï¼Œ
    "Sequence": 1921825797275873300,
    "Signature": "XXXXXXX",
    "Event": "Interrupted",
    "RoomId": "90000001237",
    "AgentInstanceId": "1921825671047294976",
    "AgentUserId": "apitest689_agent",
    "Data": {
        "Round": 1481651956,
        "Reason": 1
    }
}
```
The `Reason` parameter is explained below:
| Parameter | Type | Description |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Reason | Number | Interruption reason:<ul><li>1: User is speaking.</li><li>2: You have triggered [LLM](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Control/Send%20Agent%20instance%20LLM.mdx) on the server.</li><li>3: You have triggered [TTS](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Control/Send%20Agent%20instance%20TTS.mdx) on the server.</li><li>4: You have [interrupted the agent instance](./../API%20reference/Agent%20Instance%20Control/Interrupt%20Agent%20Instance.mdx) on the server.</li></ul> |
