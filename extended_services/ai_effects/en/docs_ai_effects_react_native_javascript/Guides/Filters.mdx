# Filters

---


The ZegoEffects SDK provides video filters with different styles that can be used in a wide range of use cases, such as live video streaming, short videos, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the SDK's video filters  in your project, make sure you complete the following steps:

- You have integrated the ZegoEffects SDK and implemented basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implement basic image processing|_blank](!Quick_Starts/Solution_Implementation).
- You have imported the basic "CommonResources" resource files. For details, see [Import resources and models|_blank](!Quick_Starts/Import_Resources).

## Implementation steps

The SDK provides video filters with the following styles:
- Natural: Creamy, Brighten, Fresh, Autumn
- Gray: Cool, Night, Film-like
- Dreamy: Sunset, Cozily, Sweet

In general, you can take the following steps to use a filter:

1. Turn on the filter by specifying the resource path of the filter.
2. Set the filter parameters as needed. If not specified, the SDK uses the default settings.


### Filters

1. Enable Filters.

    Call the [setFilter|_blank](@setFilter) interface to enable/disable the filter feature, passing in the absolute path of the corresponding filter. Call the [setFilterParam|_blank](@setFilterParam) interface to set the intensity of the filter.

    The "intensity" parameter of the [ZegoEffectsFilterParam|_blank](@-ZegoEffectsFilterParam) object, which represents the intensity of the filter, has a value range of [0, 100]. The higher the value, the greater the degree of effect presentation. Developers can customize the value according to their needs.

    <div class = 'mk-warning'>

    The effect of filter styles cannot be superimposed. After setting a new filter path, it will override the previous filter effect.
    </div>

    ```java
    // Enable filter feature
    // 1. Enable filter feature, and pass in the absolute path of the corresponding filter
    mEffects.setFilter("/xxx/xxx/Night.bundle");

    // Set filter intensity, range [0, 100]
    mEffects.setFilterParam({ intensity: 100 });
    ```

2. Remove Filter.

    If you need to remove the filter, pass `null` into the [setFilter|_blank](@setFilter) interface.

    ```java
    // Remove filter feature
    mEffects.setFilter(null);
    ```
