The ZegoEffects SDK provides various face shape retouch features, including face slimming, eyes enlarging, mouth shape adjustment, teeth whitening, and more. 


## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the SDK's face shape retouch features in your project, make sure you complete the following steps:

- You have integrated the ZegoEffects SDK and implemented basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implement basic image processing|_blank](!Quick_Starts/Solution_Implementation).
- You have imported the basic "CommonResources" resource files. For details, see [Import resources and models|_blank](!Quick_Starts/Import_Resources).

## Implementation steps

In general, take the following steps to implement a face shape retouch feature:

1. Enable the feature.
2. Specify the parameters of the face shape retouch feature as needed. If not specified, the SDK uses the default settings.


### Eyes Enlarging
