## Overview

@@@Callback_Warning@@@

During the operation of the cloud player, it will send an HTTP request to the `callback address` in the form of POST, and the request body is in JSON format. With this request, you can listen to events related to player tasks and upload tasks.

<Warning title="Warning">

Please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support to configure the callback address.
</Warning>

## Callback parameters

<Note title="Note">

ZEGOCLOUD will continuously optimize and update the callback parameters in future iterations (such as adding fields or adding parameter values for certain fields). When developers integrate, please avoid hard-coding the code, which may cause incompatibility with new versions after later updates.
</Note>

- When `EventType` is 10001, the `Detail` member list is empty.

- When `EventType` is 10006, the `Detail` member list is empty.

After detecting the above abnormal events, the cloud player will automatically retry. If you receive multiple notifications of this type of exception callback in a short period of time, developers need to check if the resource server access is normal or take other fault-tolerant measures.


## Callback example

Here is an example of a successful callback after calling the [CreatePlayer\|_blank](#17705) interface to create a cloud player.

```json
{
    "AppId": 123456789,
    "RoomId": "room_12",
    "PlayerId": "XXXXXX",
    "PlayerName": "XXXXXX",
    "EventType": 1,
    "Nonce": "abcdd22113",
    "Timestamp": "1681221510",
    "Signature": "XXXXXXX",
    "EventTime": 1681221510034,
    "Detail": {
        "CreateTime": 1681221508,
        "PlayTime": 1681221508,
        "MaxIdleTime": 30,
        "StreamUrl": "https://your-bucket.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/video/test.mp4"
    }
}
```

Here is an example of a successful callback after calling the [CreateUploadTask\|_blank](#18065) interface to create an upload task.

```json
{
    "AppID":"123456789",
    "Detail":{},
    "EventTime":"1737451074593",
    "EventType":10001,
    "Nonce":"947227",
    "Signature":"xxxxx",
    "StreamUrl":"https://your_streamurl","Timestamp":"1737451074",
    "Title":"720.mp4",
    "UploadTaskId":"678f663727b2d80007000001"
}
```

## Response

Returning an HTTP status code of 2XX (e.g. 200) indicates success, while other responses indicate failure.

## Callback retry strategy

If the ZEGOCLOUD server does not receive a response, it will immediately attempt to retry, with a maximum of 2 retries. If the callback still fails after the second retry, it will not be retried again and the callback will be lost.
