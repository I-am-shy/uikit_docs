# Create a cloud player

- - -

## Overview

Call this interface to create a cloud player. After successful creation, the cloud player will automatically load the incoming media resources and stream them to the specified room for playback.

<Warning title="Warning">

Under the same AppID, up to 50 cloud players that are currently running (not destroyed) are allowed. If you need to increase the limit, please contact ZEGOCLOUD technical support for assistance.
</Warning>

## Interface prototype
