# Face detection

---


The ZegoEffects SDK provides a face detection function, which can detect all faces in a video and the positions of the faces in the video images.


## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the SDK's face detection feature in your project, make sure you complete the following steps:

1. Integrate the ZegoEffects SDK into your project. For details, see [Integration](#9910).
2. Implement the basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implementation](#9916).
3. Import the `FaceDetectionModel`. For details, see [Import models](9920#2).


## Enable face detection


<Warning title="Warning">

To use the face detection feature, import the model file `FaceDetectionModel` first; otherwise, this feature can't take effect. For details, see [Import resources and models](!Quick_Starts/Import_Resources).
</Warning>

1. Call the `setEventHandler` method to set the callback to return the face detection result.

    ```java
    // Set the callback to return the face detection result.
    mEffects.setEventHandler(new ZegoEffectsEventHandler() {
        @Override
        public void onFaceDetectionResult(ZegoEffectsFaceDetectionResult[] results, ZegoEffects handle) {
        // Obtain the face detection result, including the number of faces, the confidence level of each detected face and its position.
        }
    });
    ```

2. Call the `enableFaceDetection` method to enable the face detection feature.

    ```java
    // Enable face detection.
    mEffects.enableFaceDetection(true);
    ```
