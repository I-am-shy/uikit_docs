# Filters

---


The ZegoEffects SDK provides video filters with different styles that can be used in a wide range of use cases, such as live video streaming, short videos, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin to use the SDK's video filters  in your project, make sure you complete the following steps:

1. Integrate the ZegoEffects SDK into your project. For details, see [Integration](#9910).
2. Implement the basic image processing functionality. For details, see [Implementation](#9916).

## Implementation steps

The SDK provides video filters with the following styles:
- Natural: Creamy, Brighten, Fresh, Autumn
- Gray: Cool, Night, Film-like
- Dreamy: Sunset, Cozily, Sweet

In general, you can take the following steps to use a filter:

1. Turn on the filter by specifying the resource path of the filter.
2. Set the filter parameters as needed. If not specified, the SDK uses the default settings.


## Turn on a filter 

To turn on a filter, do the following:

1. Call the `setFilter` method, passing the absolute path of the corresponding filter to the `path` parameter.

2. Call the `setFilterParam` method to set the filter intensity.

   The value range of the `intensity` property of `ZegoEffectsFilterParam` is  [0, 100]. As this value gets larger, the filter effect gets more intense.

You can't superimpose the effects of different filters. Once you apply a new filter, the previous one (if any) will be overridden.</div>

```java
// Turn on a filter, passing in the absolute path of the corresponding filter.
mEffects.setFilter("/xxx/xxx/Night.bundle");

// Set the filter intensity. The value range is [0, 100].
ZegoEffectsFilterParam param = new ZegoEffectsFilterParam();
param.intensity = 100;
mEffects.setFilterParam(param);
```

## Turn off the filter 

To turn off the filter, call the `setFilter` method with the `path` parameter set to `null`.

```java
// Turn off the filter.
mEffects.setFilter(null);
```
