# Run sample code

- - -

ZEGOCLOUD provides sample server code for Node.js and sample client code for iOS. You can create an application and experience all features of the mini-games with activated permissions by running the two scripts of sample code. You can also learn how to implement a mini-game service by reading the sample code.

This topic involves the following sections:

1. Run the sample server code for Node.js
2. Run the sample client code for iOS

## Run the sample client code for iOS

### Prepare the environment

Before you run the sample client code for iOS, make sure that the development environment meets the following requirements:

- Xcode 15.0 or later is installed.
- iOS 11.0 or later is installed. We recommend that you use a physical device.
- The iOS device is connected to the internet. We recommend that you use a physical device.
- CocoaPods is installed. For more information about the installation method and common issues of CocoaPods, visit the official website of CocoaPods (https://cocoapods.org/).

### Directory structure of the sample code

The following section describes the directory structure of sample code for iOS. All file paths involved in this section are based on the directory structure.

```tree
ZegoMiniGameEngineDemo/
├── Podfile
├── Podfile.lock
├── ZegoMiniGameEngineDemo
├── ZegoMiniGameEngineDemo.xcodeproj
└── ZegoMiniGameEngineDemo.xcworkspace
```

### Run the sample code

1. Open the App Store and search Xcode. Then, download and install Xcode.

2. Decompress the iOS client example source code package to get the folder "ZegoMiniGameEngineDemoSrc-iOS", and navigate to the folder using the terminal.
3. Execute the `pod repo update` command to update the local index and ensure the latest version of the SDK can be installed.
4. Execute the `pod install` command to install the SDK.
5. Open Xcode, select the menu at the top left "File > Open...", and find and open the "ZegoMiniGameEngineDemo.xcworkspace" file in the extracted example source code folder.
