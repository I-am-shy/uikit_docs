# Run sample code

---


ZEGOCLOUD provides sample server code for Node.js and sample client code for Android. You can create an application and experience all features of the mini-games with activated permissions by running the two pieces of sample code. You can also learn how to implement a mini-game service by reading the sample code.

This topic involves the following sections:

1. Run the sample server code for Node.js
2. Run the sample client code for Android

### Run the sample code

1. Decompress the package of the sample client code for Android and obtain the `ZegoMiniGameEngineDemoSrc-Android` folder.

2. Find Android Studio in your computer.

5. Modify the `app/src/main/java/im/zego/minigameenginedemo/KeyCenter.java` file by entering the application ID that is required for SDK initialization, and the **backend address** (That is, the address obtained after running the sample server code according to the [Prerequisits](#16450#2_2)).
   
    <Warning title="Warning">

    Enter the application ID that you obtain in the [Prerequisites](#16450#2_2) section of this topic in the format of application ID + L. Example: 1234567890L. Otherwise, the sample code fails to run.
   
    </Warning>   

6. Connect a real Android device to your computer. After you enable the developer mode and USB debugging feature on the device, you can view the device in Android Studio, as shown in the following figure.

   This indicates that Android Studio is connected to the Android device and you can run the sample code on the device.

7. Click the **Build and Run** button in Android Studio to compile and run the sample code. Then, you can experience the mini-game.
