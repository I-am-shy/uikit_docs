# Run sample code

- - -
ZEGO provides sample server code for Node.js and sample client code for Web. You can create an application and experience all features of the mini-games with activated permissions by running the two scripts of sample code. You can also learn how to implement a mini-game service by reading the sample code.

This topic involves the following sections:

1. Run the sample server code for Node.js
2. Run the sample client code for Web
