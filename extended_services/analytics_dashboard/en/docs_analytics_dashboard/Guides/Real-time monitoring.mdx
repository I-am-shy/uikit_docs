### Data Description

| Name | Meaning |
| -- | -- |
| Online User Count | Statistics the total number of users online at the same time. |
| Room Concurrent Count | Statistics the number of rooms alive at the same time. |
| Maximum Room User Count | The room with the most online users among all alive rooms at the current time, and the corresponding number of users. |
| Video Smoothness | Evaluate the overall video smoothness of the call, calculated by the video stutter rate of each call, the higher the smoothness, the better the user's video viewing experience; smoothness = 1 - stutter rate. |
| Audio Smoothness | Evaluate the overall audio smoothness of the call, calculated by the audio stutter rate of each call, the higher the smoothness, the better the user's audio listening experience; smoothness = 1 - stutter rate. |
| User Audio Experience | Used to evaluate the user's audio experience, divided into four levels: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor. The experience corresponding to each level is as follows: <ul><li>Excellent: High audio quality, clear and smooth.</li><li>Good: Relatively good audio quality, occasional quality loss but still clear.</li><li>Fair: Average audio quality, not very smooth, requires focused attention.</li><li>Poor: Very poor audio quality, with noise and semantic loss, difficult to communicate.</li></ul> |
| Enter Room Delay | Evaluate the user's waiting time for the login room, calculated by the interval time from the request to the successful login room, the lower the enter room delay, the lower the user's waiting time for the login room, the better the login experience. |
| First Frame Delay | Evaluate the user's waiting time for the first frame of video or the first frame of audio, calculated by the interval time from the request to the first frame rendering, the lower the first frame delay, the shorter the user's waiting time for the first frame. |
| End-to-End Delay | Evaluate the delay from the sender to the receiver, calculated by the uplink delay in the push stream region, the delay between services, the downlink delay in the pull stream region, and the local rendering time. |

## Service Monitoring

You can quickly understand the availability of room service, push service, and pull service from the "Service Monitoring" page and promptly determine whether there are service exceptions affecting a large number of users, so you can follow up and resolve issues in time to ensure business stability.

| Push Stream Success Rate | Evaluate the situation of normal connection from the client to the server for push stream request, observe this indicator to track whether there is a large-scale fault that affects the normal use of users. |
| Pull Stream Concurrent Count | Statistics the number of pull streams at the same time. |
| Pull Stream Success Rate | Evaluate the situation of normal connection from the client to the server for pull stream request, observe this indicator to track whether there is a large-scale fault that affects the normal use of users. |
