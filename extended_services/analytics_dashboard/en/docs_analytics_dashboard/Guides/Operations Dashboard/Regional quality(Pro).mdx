You can use this module to clearly see the user distribution in the global range, keep track of the quality of each region at any time, and understand which regions have a large number of users and which regions have poor quality, and adjust the operation strategy for different regions.

### Quality Trend

The right side of the "User Distribution" module shows the trend of some audio/video quality indicators in each region. **The default is to show the stutter rate and its change trend, sorted by region user count from most to least.**

The trend thumbnail displays the numerical value of the trend change next to it:

- The value is green, indicating that the trend is getting better; the larger the value, the greater the improvement.
- The value is red, indicating that the trend is getting worse; the larger the value, the greater the deterioration.

You can quickly understand the trend of indicator changes through color and value size information, helping you make relevant decisions.

If you need to know the ranking of other quality indicators in each region, you can select different indicators as needed; at the same time, you can sort by region user count, indicator value, or indicator change trend value to filter out the regions you need to pay attention to.

- When you click a region on the left map, you can quickly locate the corresponding region here and display the corresponding indicators and rankings.
