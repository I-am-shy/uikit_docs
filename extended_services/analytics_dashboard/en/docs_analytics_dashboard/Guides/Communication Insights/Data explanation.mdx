# Data Explanation

- - -

This article explains the related data in the Call Insights function module.

## Bitrate

Bitrate refers to the number of data bits transmitted per unit time during data transmission.   

Generally, the higher the bitrate, the closer the processed file is to the original file, and the better the audio and video quality. However, the higher the bitrate, the higher the performance requirements for the device; bitrate that is too low will not necessarily cause call quality problems, but generally, it will cause poorer audio and video quality.
- In normal cases, the bitrate should be close to or slightly higher than the preset value.
- In the case of network packet loss, due to data retransmission, the bitrate will be higher.

The related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Target Bitrate | The bitrate set by the client on the push stream side. |
| Audio/Video Sending Bitrate | The bitrate of the actual audio/video sent. |
| Audio/Video Receiving Bitrate | The bitrate of the actual audio/video received. |

## Frame Rate

Frame rate is the frequency (rate) at which consecutive images (frames) appear on the display machine in units of frames.   
As an important data for evaluating whether the user experience is smooth, the higher the frame rate, the smoother the video. However, a higher frame rate requires more bandwidth and CPU; a frame rate that is too low will cause a stuttering experience. Generally, a frame rate below 5fps indicates a poor user experience, and needs to be paid attention to.
- In normal cases, the actual value of the frame rate should be consistent with the preset value.

The related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Target Frame Rate | The frame rate set by the client on the push stream side. |
| Video Capture Frame Rate | The frame rate of the actual video captured by the client SDK. |
| Audio/Video Sending Frame Rate | The frame rate of the actual audio/video sent. |
| Audio/Video Receiving Frame Rate | The frame rate of the actual audio/video received. |

## Stutter Rate

A important metric for evaluating the quality of audio and video.
<Warning title="Warning">

Currently, only Native SDK (requires version 2021.1 or later) and Web SDK (requires version 2022.1 or later) support stutter rate calculation.
</Warning>

### Audio Stutter Rate
The definition of audio stutter: the duration of the audio stutter is the duration of the audio stutter when the rendering interval between two audio frames exceeds 200ms (default).

Audio stutter rate = (the sum of the durations of audio stutters in one sampling period / the total duration of audio in one sampling period) x 100%.

### Video Stutter Rate
The definition of video stutter: the duration of the video stutter is the duration of the video stutter when the rendering interval between two video frames exceeds 500ms (default).

Video stutter rate = (the sum of the durations of video stutters in one sampling period / the total duration of video in one sampling period) x 100%.

### Call Stutter Rate
Call stutter rate is an important metric for evaluating the quality of an audio and video call. It can be used to view the audio call stutter rate and video call stutter rate separately.

Call stutter rate = (the total duration of stutters in one call / the total duration of valid audio and video in one call) x 100%.

## Packet Loss Rate

Packet loss, refers to the occurrence of data packet loss during data transmission. Packet loss rate refers to the ratio of the number of data packets lost in the data transmission process to the number of data packets sent, usually expressed as a percentage.
Poor network quality may cause packet loss. Mild packet loss usually does not affect user experience, but when the packet loss rate is too high (exceeding 5%), it means that the network quality is poor, which may cause audio and video stuttering or blurring, etc., and needs to be paid attention to.

<Warning title="Warning">

Currently, only Native SDK (requires version 2022.1 or later) and Web SDK (requires version 2022.1 or later) support packet loss rate calculation; due to protocol issues, CDN service does not support packet loss rate calculation.
</Warning>


The related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Upstream Packet Loss Rate | The packet loss rate of the push stream user from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Packet Loss Rate | The packet loss rate of the pull stream user from the server to the client. |
| End-to-End Packet Loss Rate | The packet loss rate of the full link from the push client to the pull client. |

## Delay

Delay, refers to the time taken for data to be transmitted over the network. Data transmission always has delay, but low delay does not affect user interaction experience. High delay (exceeding 400ms) means that the network quality is poor, which may affect the real-time interaction of users.

<Warning title="Warning">

Currently, only Native SDK and Web SDK (requires version 2021.10 or later) support delay calculation; due to protocol issues, CDN service does not support delay calculation.
</Warning>

Delay is divided into up/downstream delay and end-to-end delay, the related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Upstream Delay | The single-way time taken by the push stream user to push data from the client to the server. |
| Downstream Delay | The single-way time taken by the pull stream user to pull data from the server to the client. |
| End-to-End Delay | The overall time taken from when the push stream user sends data from the client to the server, to when the pull stream user receives data from the server to the client. <br />Note: Unlike upstream/downstream delay, end-to-end delay includes the time for audio and video rendering, and the value may be affected by business logic (for example, when there are serious network issues, in order to ensure video smoothness, the local data buffer may be larger, resulting in a higher end-to-end delay). |

## Resolution

Resolution determines the degree of detail of the image. Generally, the higher the resolution set for the video, the more pixels it contains, and the clearer the video image will be.

<Note title="Note">

**Resolution**, **Bitrate** and **Frame Rate** are related to each other. Generally, when the resolution is fixed, the higher the bitrate, the clearer the image; and if the bitrate is fixed, the larger the resolution, the blurrier the image. It is recommended to set the resolution, bitrate, and frame rate reasonably to achieve better image quality.
</Note>

The related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Encoded Resolution | The resolution of the encoded video. |
| Decoded Resolution | The resolution of the decoded video. |

## Volume

Volume represents the size of the sound collected and decoded by the SDK.

<Note title="Note">

The volume data provided in Analytics Dashboard does not represent the user's actual perception of the sound; it represents the volume level as collected and decoded by the SDK.
The volume data provided in the star chart does not represent the user's true feeling of the sound, it represents the size of the sound collected and decoded by the SDK;
</Note>


The related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| Microphone Input Volume | The volume of the input of the microphone. |
| Speaker Output Volume | The volume of the output of the speaker. |

## Device Status

It represents the usage status of the user's device, including system CPU usage, app CPU usage, system memory usage, app memory usage, and total memory, the related metrics and their explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric | Explanation |
| -- | -- |
| System CPU Usage | The CPU usage of the system. If the device performance is poor, the system CPU usage may be too high when pushing and pulling streams, causing audio and video stuttering. |
| App CPU Usage | The CPU usage of the app. If the device performance is poor, the app CPU usage may be too high when pushing and pulling streams, causing audio and video stuttering. |
| System Memory Usage | The usage of the system memory. If the device memory is too small, the memory usage may be insufficient, which may cause the audio and video software to play abnormally, causing stuttering, black screen, etc. |
| App Memory Usage | The usage of the app memory. If the memory usage is too low or too high, it usually indicates that the app is abnormal, and needs to be paid attention to. |
| Total Memory | The total memory of the system. Some devices may not be able to obtain this data, for reference only. |
