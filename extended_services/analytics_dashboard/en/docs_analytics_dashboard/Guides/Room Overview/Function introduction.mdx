### Function Introduction

#### View Room Basic Information

The top of the room details page is the room basic information module, which displays the basic indicators such as room duration, current in-room user count, peak in-room user count, total in-room user count, total push stream user count, audio/video stutter rate, etc., helping users quickly understand the room scale and in-room user experience.

<Note title="Note">If you need to further understand the meaning of each data, please refer to [Data Description](./Data%20explanation.mdx).</Note>

#### View Room Experience Trend

The room basic information below is the room experience trend module, which displays the dynamic change trend of the in-room user count, push stream concurrency, audio stutter rate, and video stutter rate in the set time range. Through an intuitive chart, users can clearly observe the fluctuation of each indicator over time, making it easier to analyze the regularities and abnormal points in the room operation process.

- The in-room user count chart displays the trend and relationship of the in-room user count, audio stutter count, and video stutter count during the lifecycle of the room. This helps you determine whether there are widespread severe stutter issues. By clicking the floating window "View Users with Audio/Video Stutter at This Time", you can quickly jump to the User Analysis module to further understand the details of users experiencing stutter, making it easier to analyze the audio and video quality within the room.

    </Frame>

- The push stream concurrency chart displays the change trend of the push stream number during the room lifecycle, helping you determine whether the user experience problem is caused by the push/pull stream number, click the floating window "View Push Stream List" to quickly jump to the stream list module, and view more related stream information.

</Frame>

- Stutter Distribution

    Monitors and displays the timing and source information of audio and video stutter incidents within the room. It can accurately pinpoint the specific time points or periods where more than 10% of users experience audio/video stutter, and also highlight countries/regions, pull stream sources, system platforms, etc., with higher stutter rates. This helps developers quickly understand the stutter distribution and provides direction for troubleshooting and resolving stutter issues.

- Abnormal Anchors

    Intelligently identifies anchors with abnormal conditions in the room. It lists the user ID, push stream duration, and specific abnormal phenomena (such as abnormal room exit) for abnormal anchors.

    By clicking the "View User Details" button, you can quickly jump to the Analytics Dashboard user monitoring details page, making it easy to further understand the detailed information of abnormal anchors. This allows you to promptly address anchor abnormalities and ensure the normal operation of audio and video services in the room.

#### User Analysis

The user analysis module provides comprehensive and detailed user data insights for developers, specifically:
- User List  
    - The user list is presented in a table format, providing an overview of the information of the in-room pull stream users, including user ID, in-room time, audio stutter rate, video stutter rate, pull stream source, user region, network type, platform version. Through these data, developers can quickly understand the audio/video experience status and basic information of a single user in the room.
        <Frame width="auto" height="auto" >
          <img src="https://media-resource.spreading.io/docuo/workspace564/27e54a759d23575969552654cb45bf89/2ce644bf69.png" alt="image (30).png"/>
        </Frame>
    - Due to the fact that there are often many pull stream users in the room in some scenarios, the user list can only return up to 200 data at a time. You can use the user ID query and filtering/sorting functions in the user list header to find the data you are interested in, as shown in the figure below, filtering the region to Turkey and sorting by audio stutter rate from high to low.

        </Frame>
    - Click the "View User Details" button to jump to the Analytics Dashboard user monitoring details page, obtaining the quality details of the user, making it easier to analyze individual user problems.
- Distribution Statistics  

    The distribution statistics function decomposes the total user quantity and stutter data from different dimensions, providing you with a multi-faceted analysis perspective, making it easier to analyze the overall communication situation of the room, and optimizing service quality under different dimensions to improve user experience.

    </Frame>

#### Stream List

The stream list module summarizes the user experience and usage of each audio/video stream in the room at the stream dimension, helping you quickly confirm whether the user stutter is caused by the push side or the intermediate link.

Click the "View User Details" button to jump to the Analytics Dashboard communication insights push details page, obtaining the quality details of the stream, making it easier to analyze the stream dimension problems.
