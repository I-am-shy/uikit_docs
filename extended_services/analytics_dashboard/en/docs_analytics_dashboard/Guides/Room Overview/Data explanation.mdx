## In-room User Count

In-room User Count, refers to the number of users in the room. The in-room user count is calculated every minute, and if the room is created and destroyed quickly within the statistical time interval, the Star Graph will not count the in-room user count of the room.

In the room overview, the related terms and explanations are shown in the following table:

| Metric            | Explanation                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Peak In-room User Count     | Refers to the maximum in-room user count of the room within the query time interval.                              |
| Current In-room User Count     | Refers to the in-room user count of the room in the last minute. <Note>If the room is closed or the query end time is before the current time, the current in-room user count field is invalid. </Note> |
| Total In-room User Count     | Refers to the total in-room user count of the room within the query time interval (deduplicated by user).                |
| Total Push Stream User Count     | Refers to the total number of push stream users in the room within the query time interval (deduplicated by user).                |

## Audio Stutter Rate


When the rendering interval between two audio frames exceeds 200ms (default), it is counted as one audio stutter, and the duration is counted as the duration of this stutter.

Audio Stutter Rate = (the sum of the audio stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of audio in one sampling period) x 100% 。

In the room overview, there are three places related to the audio stutter rate:

| Location     | Explanation                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Room Details | The average audio stutter rate of all in-room users in the query time interval.     |
| User Analysis | The average audio stutter rate of the user in the query time interval.         |
| Stream List   | The average audio stutter rate of all pull streams corresponding to the push stream in the query time interval. |

## Video Stutter Rate

When the rendering interval between two video frames exceeds 500ms (default), it is counted as one video stutter, and the duration is counted as the duration of this stutter.

Video Stutter Rate = (the sum of the video stutter duration in one sampling period / the total duration of video in one sampling period) x 100% 。

In the room overview, there are three places related to the video stutter rate:

| Location     | Explanation                                           |
|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| Room Details | The average video stutter rate of all in-room users in the query time interval.     |
| User Analysis | The average video stutter rate of the user in the query time interval.         |
| Stream List   | The average video stutter rate of all pull streams corresponding to the push stream in the query time interval. |
