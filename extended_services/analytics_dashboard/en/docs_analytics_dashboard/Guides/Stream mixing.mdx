# Stream Mixing Service

---

The Stream Mixing Service provides you with the ability to monitor online stream mixing tasks. By leveraging detailed configuration information and the quality of input/output streams, you can build a model of the mixing task and precisely locate any anomalies that occur online.

## Feature Overview

The Stream Mixing Service includes two sub-pages, each offering different functionalities:

| Sub-page         | Function                                                                                                                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Search Page      | The Search Page displays the basic input and output information of the stream mixing tasks. You can filter tasks using various criteria to locate the mixing tasks of interest and further investigate their details. |
| Mixing Detail Page | The Mixing Detail Page shows both the initial and effective configurations for a mixing task over its lifecycle, and also provides quality information for input/output streams and downstream users, enabling you to model the mixing process and efficiently locate issues occurring in stream mixing scenarios. |

## Access Steps
1. Log in to the [ZEGOCLOUD Admin Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/), and enter Analytics Dashboard from the left navigation bar;
2. Click "Stream Mixing Service" in the navigation bar, and you can access the "Search Page".

### Function Introduction
1. Select AppID (required), input input stream ID, output stream ID, TaskID, Worker ID, push/pull stream user ID or stream ID (optional), select the time range you need to query, click "Query", and you can get the stream mixing task record list (i.e. search result) within the time range.
2. Support multiple filter conditions combination query, or narrow down the query time range, can be more accurately search stream mixing record.

#### Stream Mixing Diagnosis

The stream mixing basic information below is the stream mixing diagnosis module, which can actively identify abnormal events during the call, and classify events based on severity into "abnormal" and "reminder", directly display the diagnosis results in **Call Diagnosis**. You can click to view the exception details and reasons, and thus locate exceptions with low threshold and high efficiency.

</Frame>

- Basic Information

    The list form presents the key basic information of the stream mixing input stream, including the source room ID, push stream user ID, stream ID, URL, and Task start and end time. These information provides the basic background for the user to quickly understand the data source and time span information.
