## Analytics Dashboard

[Analytics Dashboard(AD)](https://console.zegocloud.com/) is ZEGOCLOUD's audio and video quality operations platform for developers. It helps developers comprehensively monitor audio and video services, reconstruct call quality and interaction scenarios, and efficiently identify and troubleshoot issues with low barriers, ultimately improving audio and video quality and user experience.

<Note title="Note">

To better utilize Analytics Dashboard, it is recommended to use Express SDK version 3.0 or above to further enhance the reliability of data reporting.

## Call Insights
With Call Insights, you can efficiently identify and diagnose issues with low barriers, and reconstruct audio/video quality and user interaction experience details.
- Monitor quality throughout the entire lifecycle of audio and video calls
- Evaluate the scale of impact to determine whether issues affect a broad range of users or are isolated cases
- Track user behavior, reconstruct end-to-end user experience, investigate call quality, locate issues, and perform root cause analysis

## User Monitoring
Through User Monitoring, you can track users' room footprints throughout their lifecycle, view stream publishing/playing quality and user behavior events, proactively diagnose user anomalies, and perform anomaly attribution.
- Quickly view target users' room footprints throughout their lifecycle and query specific rooms
- Get an overview of user behavior and stream quality in specified rooms, reconstruct user behavior and experience, and identify periods of poor experience
- Automatically identify anomalies throughout the user lifecycle and analyze root causes, helping developers resolve user issues and improve user experience

## Room Overview

With Room Overview, you can quickly view room lifecycles and in-room user quality, deeply analyze potential anomalies in room users and stream publishing/playing.
- Quickly filter and locate problematic rooms based on overview information of online room lifecycles and user quality
- Use call diagnostics to monitor stutter distribution in audio/video calls, identify abnormal hosts, and precisely locate anomaly points
- Leverage user analysis to comprehensively understand various information about in-room users and grasp how different factors affect stutter patterns
- Through the stream list module, clearly understand detailed operational data of each stream and quickly locate stream-related quality issues
