# Get whiteboard list

- - -


This document describes how to obtain the list of whiteboards that are being shared in a room.

## Prerequisites

Create a whiteboard by referring to [Getting started\|_blank](!ZegoSuperBoard-QuickStart/CreateWboard).

## Implementation steps

In the following scenarios, you can call querySuperBoardSubViewList to retrieve the list of whiteboards:

1. If you enter a room for the first time, you can proactively fetch the list of whiteboards created in the room.
2. If you are already in a room, you will need to obtain the list of all whiteboards.

```javascript
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().querySuperBoardSubViewList().then(function(zegoSuperBoardSubViewModelList){
    // After obtaining the ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel, you can perform updates on the interface. 
    // For example, you can populate it into a UI list or handle corresponding business logic ...
})
```
