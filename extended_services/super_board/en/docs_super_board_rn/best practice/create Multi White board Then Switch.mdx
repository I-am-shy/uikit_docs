# Create and switch between multiple whiteboards

- - -


## Overview

This document describes how to create multiple whiteboards using the Super Board SDK and switch between them freely. The example scenario in this document is as follows:
1. Create a common whiteboard.
2. Switch to the common whiteboard, enter a line of words on the whiteboard, and then zoom in on the whiteboard.


## Prerequisites

A project has been created in [ZEGOCLOUD console](https://console.zegocloud.com/account/login) and applied for a valid AppID. For details, please refer to [How to view project information](https://docs.zegocloud.com/article/16144).


## Implementation steps

<Frame width="512" height="auto" caption=""><img src="https://storage.zego.im/sdk-doc/Pics/WhiteboardView/Superboard_bestpractice_EN.png" /></Frame>

Assume that A creates a whiteboard and operates on it and that B watches the whiteboard in this flow. In the preceding figure, the dotted line indicates that B can obtain related information from the corresponding callback when A performs the operation.

### 1. Initialize the SDK and log in to the room


Refer to [Create a super board](../Quick%20start/Create%20white%20board.mdx) to integrate and initialize the SDK and log in to the room. The complete sample code is as follows:

#### Initialize the SDK
```javascript
// Integrate the SDK before executing the following code.
// Initialize ZegoExpressEngine.
// The following initialization sample code is recommended to be executed when the application starts.
// Access in general scenarios.
const profile = {
    appID : xxx,
    // cuide for upgrading the authentication mode from using the AppSign to Token](https://docs.zegocloud.com/faq/token_upgrade?product=ExpressVideo&platform=all)
    // AppSign can be obtained through [ZEGOCLOUD console](https://console.zegocloud.com/account/login) in the format of @"39011cbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
    appSign: '39011cbxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
    scenario : 0
};

var engine = ZegoExpressEngine.createEngineWithProfile(profile)

if (engine != null) {
    var superboardConfig = {
      appID: YOURAPPID,
      appSign: 'YOURAPPSIGN',
    };

initSuperboad = async () => {
    // Initialize ZegoSuperBoard SDK
    const superboard_init_res = await ZegoSuperBoardManager.init(superboardConfig);
    //  The result of SuperBoard initialization.
    console.log('Result', superboard_init_res);
  };
initSuperboad()
}
```

#### Log in to the room

```javascript
// The prerequisite for logging into the room is that the Express SDK has been successfully initialized.
// Start logging into the room.
engine.loginRoom('room1', {'userID': 'id1', 'userName': 'user1'});
```

### 2. Create a whiteboard

Define an area to mount the whiteboard

```javascript
<ZegoSuperBoardRenderView ref={this.refContainer} style={[styles.boardView]} />
```

```javascript
// After successfully logging into the room, the area needs to be passed in, and it only needs to be done once. 
const tag = findNodeHandle(this.refContainer.current);
    await ZegoSuperBoardManager.setContainerView({
      reactTag: tag,
    });
```

```javascript
// The following example code defines a encapsulation method, which can realize the functions of creating a common whiteboard.

/**
 * Create a common whiteboard.
 */
var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()

const res = await zegoSuperBoard.createWhiteboardView({
    name: 'test whiteboard', // The name of the whiteboard created. 
    pageCount: 5, // Number of whiteboard pages created
    perPageWidth: 960, // Page width
    perPageHeight: 540,// Page height
});
```

After the whiteboard is created, the SuperBoardView will automatically synchronize across multiple platforms and display the latest created whiteboard. The B end will receive a [remoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded](@remoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded) notification every time the A end creates a whiteboard, and the local UI logic can be refreshed in the corresponding callback.

**Register the SuperBoardManager Listener callback method to monitor actions such as remote whiteboard addition, destruction, and switching.**

```javascript
// Common callbacks related to SuperBoard 
// SuperBoard automatically implements the ability to synchronize across multiple platforms, and only needs to refresh the local UI logic in the remote notification callback.
// Listen for error callbacks. SDK internal errors are all thrown through this callback, except for errors returned directly in the interface.

    // Get instance
    var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()

    // Listen for the remotely added whiteboard.
    zegoSuperBoard.on('remoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded', function(name,createTime,fileID,fileType,uniqueID,whiteboardIDList) {

    });

    // Listen for remote whiteboard destruction.
    zegoSuperBoard.on('remoteSuperBoardSubViewRemoved', function(name,createTime,fileID,fileType,uniqueID,whiteboardIDList) {

    });

    // Listen for remote whiteboard switching.
    zegoSuperBoard.on('remoteSuperBoardSubViewSwitched', function(uniqueID) {

    });
```

**Register the SuperBoardView callback method to listen for scrolling and page-turning in the SuperBoardView.**

```javascript
     // Get instance
    var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()

    // Listening for whiteboard page turning and scrolling 
    zegoSuperBoard.on('scrollChange', function(name,createTime,fileID,fileType,uniqueID,whiteboardIDList,currentPage,pageCount) {

    });

```

You can use [setOperationMode](@setOperationMode)  to grant permissions for clients to operate on the whiteboard.
Clients with permissions can draw on the whiteboard. For more details, please refer to [Draw](../Basic%20Function/Sketch.mdx).

### 3. Switch to the common whiteboard for drawing

To synchronize the zooming effect among multiple parties, you must enable the zooming effect synchronization and responding functions on each party.

```javascript
// The zooming effect needs to be synchronized between the local and peer parties.
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().enableSyncScale(true);// Synchronize the zooming effect to the other party.
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().enableResponseScale(true);// Respond to the zooming effect synchronized from the other party.
```

User A switches to the common whiteboard, uses the text tool to write on the whiteboard, and uses gestures to zoom in or out.
```javascript
// Operations by user A
// Switch to the target whiteboard.
var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()
await zegoSuperBoard.getSuperBoardView().switchSuperBoardSubView(uniqueID);

// The default whiteboard tool is brush. To set other tool types, call setToolType.
// For example, set the tool type to text, click on the whiteboard where you want to display the text, and enter the text.
zegoSuperBoard.setToolType(2)

// Get the currently displayed whiteboard
var curSubView = zegoSuperBoardSubView.getSuperBoardView().getCurrentSuperBoardSubView();
```

After the A end switches the whiteboard, the B end will automatically switch synchronously and receive the [remoteSuperBoardSubViewSwitched](@remoteSuperBoardSubViewSwitched)notification.This callback has been implemented in the previous step.
