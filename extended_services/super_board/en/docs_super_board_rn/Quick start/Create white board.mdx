<Note title="Note">
This document is applicable to the following platforms: iOS, Android.
</Note>

## Basic concepts

- ZegoExpress-Video SDK: Audio and video interactive SDK of ZEGO, which can provide the real-time signaling transmission capability required by the Super Board. The Super Board SDK must be used together with this SDK.
- Super Board SDK and ZegoSuperBoard SDK: Both refer to the SDKs that provide the ZEGO Super Board service, that is, ZegoSuperBoard. 
- ZegoSuperBoardView: Whiteboard view used by developers for presentation during code implementation.
- ZegoSuperBoardSubView: Subset of ZegoSuperBoardView, which is actually created by developers. ZegoSuperBoardView will automatically presents the newly created ZegoSuperBoardSubView or specified ZegoSuperBoardSubView using [`switchSuperBoardSubView`\|_blank](/article/api?doc=superboard_API~objective-c_ios~class~ZegoSuperBoardView#switch-super-board-sub-view-unique-id-complete).
- Common whiteboard: Whiteboard created by specifying the width, height, and number of pages, and drawn by a user in real time on the specified whiteboard canvas.

</div>

## Prepare the environment

Before integrating the ZegoSuperBoard SDK, ensure that the development environment satisfies the following requirements:

- React Native is in version 0.60 or later.
- The iOS system is in version 9.0 or later and supports audio and video iOS devices or simulators (real devices are recommended).
- An Android device or emulator with Android version no less than 5.0 and supporting audio and video (real devices are recommended). If it is a real device, please turn on the "Allow debugging" option.
- iOS/Android  devices have been connected to the Internet.
- Install [Node.js\|_blank](https://nodejs.org/en/). It is recommended to use the long-term support version shown on the homepage of its official website.


## (optional) Create a new project

<Note title="Note">

If you already have a project, you can skip this step.
</Note>

If you need to know how to create a React Native project, please refer to the official React Native documentation [Setting up the development environment\|_blank](https://www.reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). 
</details>

## Project configuration

### iOS

1. Install CocoaPods. For installation methods and FAQs, please refer to [CocoaPods Installation Guide \|_blank](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#getting-started).

2. Execute the `pod install` command in the project's iOS directory to install the SDK.

### Android

#### Add dependencies

Super Board SDK depends on the following modules. Add the following code under the `dependencies` node in the "your project/android/app/build.gradle" file:

```groovy
implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0'
implementation 'org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk8:1.4.30'
```

#### Setting permissions
To add a permission statement, open the "your project/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" file and add the following content:

@@@superboard_android_permission@@@

#### Preventing confusion

In the “your project/android/app/proguard-rules.pro” file, add the -keep class configuration for the SDK, which will prevent obfuscation of the SDK public class names.

@@@superboard_proguardrules_android@@@

## Integrate the SDK

Go to the root directory of your project through the terminal and install the SDK through the yarn/npm command (Contact the ZEGOCLOUD technical support to know the command).

## Import the SDK

Use the following method to import Express Video SDK and Super Board SDK.

```typescript
import ZegoExpressEngine from 'zego-express-engine-whiteboard-reactnative';
import ZegoSuperBoardManager, {ZegoSuperBoardRenderView} from 'zego-superboard-reactnative';
```

## Implement the Super Board

### 1. Initialize the SDK

#### Initialize the ZEGO Express Video SDK

Call the [`createEngineWithProfile`\|_blank](https://doc-zh.zego.im/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#createenginewithprofile) interface of Express Video SDK and pass in the applied AppID and AppSign Parameters "appID" and "appSign" create an engine singleton object.


If you need to register a callback method, developers can implement Express Video SDK's [ZegoEventListener\|_blank](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/zh/javascript_react-native/interfaces/_zegoexpresseventhandler_.zegoeventlistener.html),   you can create an engine by calling some of the methods in [`on`\|_blank](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#on) interface after creating the engine.

```javascript
// Use common scenarios
const profile = {
    appID: YOURAPPID,
    // AppSign can be obtained through [Console](https://console.zegocloud.com/account/login)
    appSign: 'YOURAPPSIGN',
    scenario : 0
};

ZegoExpressEngine.createEngineWithProfile(profile)
```

#### Initialize ZegoSuperBoard SDK

Get the ZegoSuperBoard instance using the [getInstance\|_blank](@getInstance) method of [ZegoSuperBoardManager\|_blank](@-ZegoSuperBoardManager).

```typescript
const superboardConfig = {
  appID: YOURAPPID,
  appSign: 'YOURAPPSIGN',
};

initSuperboad = async () => {
    // Initialize ZegoSuperBoard SDK
    const superboard_init_res = await ZegoSuperBoardManager.init(superboardConfig);
    // Initialization result
    console.log('Result', superboard_init_res);
  };
initSuperboad()
```

<Warning title="Warning">

Please initialize ZegoExpress-Video SDK and ZegoSuperBoard SDK successfully before calling the login room interface.
</Warning>

### 2. Listen for event callbacks

Based on the actual application needs, you can listen for the concerned event callbacks after the ZegoSuperBoard SDK is initialized. The callbacks include error reminders, adding whiteboard files remotely, deleting whiteboard files remotely, and switching whiteboard files remotely.


<Warning title="Warning">

The SuperBoard automatically realizes the multi-end synchronization capability, and only needs to refresh the local UI logic in the remote notification callback.
</Warning>

[on\|_blank](@on): Register a callback event and specify the listening event name through event.

```javascript
// Commonly used SuperBoard related callbacks
// SuperBoard automatically implements multi-end synchronization capabilities, and only needs to refresh the local UI logic in the remote notification callback.
// Listen for error callbacks. SDK internal errors are thrown through this callback, except for errors returned directly in the interface.

    // Get Instance
    var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()
    zegoSuperBoard.on('error', function(errorData) {
        // Error code, error message
        console.log(errorData.code, errorData.message)
    });

    // Listen for whiteboard page turning and scrolling
    zegoSuperBoard.on("scrollChange", function (name, createTime, fileID, fileType, uniqueID, whiteboardIDList, currentPage, pageCount) {}
    );

    // Listen for new remote whiteboards
    zegoSuperBoard.on("remoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded", function (name, createTime, fileID, fileType, uniqueID, whiteboardIDList) {});

    // Listen for remote destruction of whiteboard
    zegoSuperBoard.on("remoteSuperBoardSubViewRemoved", function (name, createTime, fileID, fileType, uniqueID, whiteboardIDList) {});

    // Listen for remote switching whiteboard
    zegoSuperBoard.on("remoteSuperBoardSubViewSwitched", function (uniqueID) {});

    // Listen for remote whiteboard permission changes
    zegoSuperBoard.on("remoteSuperBoardAuthChanged", function (data) {});

    // Listen for remote whiteboard element permission changes
    zegoSuperBoard.on("remoteSuperBoardGraphicAuthChanged", function (data) {});

```

### 3. Log in to the room

You can call the [`loginRoom`\|_blank](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#loginroom) interface of Express Video SDK to log in to the room. If the room does not exist, the room will be created and logged in when this interface is called.

The parameters of roomID and user are generated locally by you, but they need to meet the following conditions:：

- Within the same AppID, "roomID" must be globally unique.  
- Within the same AppID, "userID" must be globally unique. It is recommended that developers associate "userID" with their own business account system.

```javascript
// Log in to room
ZegoExpressEngine.instance().loginRoom('room1', {'userID': 'id1', 'userName': 'user1'});
```

```javascript

// The following are commonly used room-related callbacks

ZegoExpressEngine.instance().on('roomStateUpdate', (roomID, state, errorCode, extendedData) => {
  // Room status update callback. After logging in to the room, when the room connection status changes (such as room disconnection, login authentication failure, etc.), the SDK will notify through this callback
}); ;
```

### 4. Create a whiteboard

A Super Board can be used to create a common whiteboard.
- Common whiteboard: Whiteboard created by specifying the width, height, and number of pages, and drawn by a user in real time on the specified whiteboard canvas.

Before creating a whiteboard, ensure that the login is successful, that is, you can only create a whiteboard after logging in to the room and returning true.

#### Create a common whiteboard

1. Define an area to mount the whiteboard

```javascript
<ZegoSuperBoardRenderView ref={refContainer} style={{ height: 500, width: 300 } />
```
<Warning title="Warning">
The width and height of the area where the whiteboard is mounted must not be less than 0.
</Warning>

2. Create a common whiteboard

```typescript
// You can only create a whiteboard after successfully logging into the room.

// After successful login, this area needs to be passed in
const tag = findNodeHandle(refContainer.current);
    await ZegoSuperBoardManager.setContainerView({
      reactTag: tag,
    });

// Get instance
var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()
const res = await zegoSuperBoard.createWhiteboardView({
    name: 'test whiteboard', // The name of the created whiteboard
    pageCount: 5, // Number of whiteboard pages created
    perPageWidth: 960, // page width
    perPageHeight: 540,// page height
});
```

<Warning title="Warning">

- At most 50 whiteboards can be created in a room. The whiteboard creation will fail if the room already has 50 whiteboards.
- To obtain the current number of whiteboards in a room, call the [querySuperBoardSubViewList\|_blank](@querySuperBoardSubViewList) method.
- 
</Warning>

### 5. Verify whiteboard creation

Use multiple devices to run the preceding project and log in to the same room ID. Press and move with your finger within the range of ZegoSuperBoardView on any device. Then the graffiti effect is displayed on ZegoSuperBoardView of the device.

### 6. Destroy a whiteboard

```typescript
// After a whiteboard is destroyed, the SDK will automatically switch to another whiteboard. The displayed whiteboard is the previous one of the destroyed whiteboard.
// subViewModel is a model in the whiteboard sharing list ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().querySuperBoardSubViewList().
// Get Instance
var zegoSuperBoard = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance()
const result = await zegoSuperBoard.destroySuperBoardSubView(uniqueID)
```

### 7. Leave the room

Call the [logoutRoom](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#logoutroom) interface of [ZegoExpressEngine](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html) to leave the room.

```js
engine.logoutRoom(roomID);
```

### 8. Deinitialize the SDK

#### Deinitialize the ZegoSuperBoard SDK

Call the [unInit](https://doc-en.zego.im/en/interactiveboard/ios/api/zegosuperboardmanager#uninit) method of [ZegoSuperBoardManager](https://doc-en.zego.im/en/interactiveboard/ios/api/zegosuperboardmanager) to deinitialize the ZegoSuperBoard SDK.

```js
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().unInit();
```

#### Deinitialize the ZEGO Express Video SDK

If you no longer need the capabilities of ZEGO Express Video SDK, you can call the [destroyEngine](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html#destroyengine) method of [ZegoExpressEngine](/unique-api/express-video-sdk/en/javascript_react-native/classes/_zegoexpressengine_.zegoexpressengine.html) to destroy the engine and release resources such as microphone, camera, memory, CPU, etc.

```js
ZegoExpressEngine.destroyEngine();
```
