<Note title="Note">

- The Super Board SDK needs to be used together with the ZegoExpress-Video SDK (whiteboard feature included), which provides real-time signaling transmission capabilities. This document does not provide that SDK; it must be obtained separately. If your project has already integrated the Express-Video SDK, you need to remove the old package and reintegrate according to the [Getting started - Integrate SDKs](!ZegoSuperBoard-QuickStart/CreateWboard#5) documentation to avoid initialization failures caused by SDK version mismatches.
- Sample app: For the sample app and how to run the sample code, see [Sample app](./sample%20app.mdx).
- SDK integration: To integrate the SDK and getting started, see [Create a super board](./Quick%20start/Create%20white%20board.mdx).
