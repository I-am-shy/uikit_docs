# Get the whiteboard list

- - -

This document describes how to obtain the list of whiteboards that are being shared in a room.

## Prerequisites

Create a whiteboard by referring to [Getting started\|_blank](!QuickStart/CreateWboard).


## Implementation process
1. If you enter a room for the first time, you can proactively fetch the list of whiteboards created in the room.

```objc
[[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance] querySuperBoardSubViewList:^(ZegoSuperBoardError errorCode, NSArray<ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel *> * _Nonnull superBoardViewList) {
    // After subViewModelList is obtained, update the whiteboard list on the interface.
    // For example, update them to the whiteboard list.
     if (errorCode == ZegoSuperBoardSuccess) {
            /** The whiteboard list is obtained. */
     } else {
            /** Failed to obtain the whiteboard list. */
     } 
}];
```


2. If you are already in a room, you will need to obtain the list of all whiteboards.

```objc
// Obtain the list of all existing whiteboards. For example, display them in the whiteboard list.
 NSArray <ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel *>* array = [ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].superBoardSubViewModelList;
// Process the corresponding service logic.
```
