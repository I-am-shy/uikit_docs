- - -

This document describes how to zoom on the whiteboard being displayed.

The following figure shows the effect of whiteboard zooming on the web client, and the effect on the mobile client is the same.

## Prerequisites

Creat a whiteboard by referring to [Create a super board](../quick-start/create-white-board.mdx).


## Implementation steps

The zooming function is enabled by default. You can use gestures to zoom in and out on a whiteboard.

<Note title="Note">

If the [toolType](@toolType) is set to [ZegoSuperBoardToolClick](@ZegoSuperBoardToolClick), this function is disabled and the whiteboard cannot be zoomed in or out using gestures.

</Note>

The zooming functions of ZegoSuperBoard can be configured as follows:

- Call the [setOperationMode](@setOperationMode) method to set the operation mode to `ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeZoom` to enable the zooming function of ZegoSuperBoard.
- Call the [setOperationMode](@setOperationMode) method to set the operation mode to `ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeDraw|ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeZoom` to enable both the drawing and zooming functions.

```objc
ZegoSuperBoardSubView *superBoardSubView = [ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].superBoardView.currentSuperBoardSubView;

// Enable both the drawing and zooming functions.
[superBoardSubView setOperationMode:ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeDraw|ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeZoom];

// Enable only the zooming function.
//[superBoardSubView setOperationMode:ZegoSuperBoardOperationModeZoom];


```

Use the following methods to enable the synchronous zooming function to synchronously zoom in and out for all parties.

```objc
// Enable the synchronous zooming function.
[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].enableSyncScale = YES;
// Enable the function of receiving the synchronous zooming effect.
[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].enableResponseScale = YES;

```
