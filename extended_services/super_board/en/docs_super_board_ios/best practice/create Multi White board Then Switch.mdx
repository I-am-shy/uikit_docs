# Create and switch between multiple whiteboards

- - -
## Overview

This document describes how to create multiple whiteboards using the Super Board SDK and switch between them freely. The example scenario in this document is as follows:
1. Create a common whiteboard.
2. Switch to the common whiteboard, enter a line of words on the whiteboard, and then zoom in on the whiteboard.


## Implementation steps

Assume that A creates a whiteboard and operates on it and that B watches the whiteboard in this flow. In the preceding figure, the dotted line indicates that B can obtain related information from the corresponding callback when A performs the operation.


### Initialize the SDK and log in to the room
Refer to [Create a super board](../Quick%20start/Create%20white%20board.mdx) to integrate and initialize the SDK and log in to the room. The complete sample code is as follows:

```objc
// Integrate the SDK before executing the following code.
// Initialize ZegoExpressEngine.
ZegoEngineProfile *profile = [ZegoEngineProfile new];
// Register with the official website and obtain the data in the format similar to 1234567890.
profile.appID = appID; 
// Register on the official website and obtain a string of 64 characters in the format similar to @"0123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123" (64 characters in total).
profile.appSign = appSign; 
// Access in general scenarios.
profile.scenario = ZegoScenarioGeneral; 
// Create an engine and register self as the eventHandler callback. If there's no need to register a callback, eventHandler can be set as nil, and call the -setEventHandler: method to set the callback later on.
[ZegoExpressEngine createEngineWithProfile:profile eventHandler:self];

// Obtain an instance of ZegoSuperBoard.
ZegoSuperBoardManager *superBoardManager = [ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance];
// Register a proxy.
superBoardManager.delegate = self;
// Initialize ZegoSuperBoard.
ZegoSuperBoardInitConfig * config = [ZegoSuperBoardInitConfig new];
config.appID = appID;// Enter the value of `appID` obtained from the ZEGO Admin Console.
config.appSign = appSign;// Enter the value of `appSign` obtained from the ZEGO Admin Console.

[[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance] initWithConfig:config complete:^(ZegoSuperBoardError errorCode) {
       // The result of SuperBoard initialization is returned. 
 }];

// Log in to the room.
// Set isUserStatusNotify to YES to receive the [onRoomUserUpdate] callback. The listening mechanism is disabled by default.
NSString *userID = userID;// Set it to userID used to log in to the room.
NSString *userName = userName;// Set it based on your requirement.
NSString *roomID = roomID;//
// Create a user.
ZegoUser *user = [ZegoUser userWithUserID:userID userName:userName];
// Set it to YES to receive the [onRoomUserUpdate] callback
ZegoRoomConfig *config = [[ZegoRoomConfig alloc] init];
config.isUserStatusNotify = YES;
// Log in.
[expressEngine loginRoom:roomID user:user config:config];

// Listen for the room status callback.
- (void)onRoomStateUpdate:(ZegoRoomState)state errorCode:(int)errorCode extendedData:(NSDictionary *)extendedData roomID:(NSString *)roomID {
    
    if (state == ZegoRoomStateConnected && errorCode == 0) { 
        // Login to the room is successful.
    }
}
```

### Create a whiteboard

Assume that A creates a common whiteboard.
```objc
// Operations by user A
// A whiteboard can be created only after the user successfully logs in to the room.
// Create a common whiteboard.
ZegoCreateWhiteboardConfig * config = [ZegoCreateWhiteboardConfig new];
config.name = Whiteboard name;
config.pageCount = 5;
config.perPageWidth = 16;
config.perPageHeight = 9;
[[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance] createWhiteboardView:config complete:^(ZegoSuperBoardError errorCode, ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel *model) {
      // The result of creating a common whiteboard and the data model of ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel are returned.

}];
```

After the whiteboards are created, `SuperBoardView` automatically synchronizes the whiteboard creation to multiple parties. The last created whiteboard is displayed by default. User B receives the `remoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded` or `onScrollChange:pageCount:subViewModel` notification each time when user A creates a whiteboard. User B can refresh the local UI logic in the corresponding callback.

```objc
// User B listens for the callback and refreshes the local UI logic in the callback.
// Listen for the remotely added whiteboard.
- (void)onRemoteSuperBoardSubViewAdded:(ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel *)model
{
    // The UI can be updated based on the information returned in ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel.
}

// Listen for the whiteboard page turning and scrolling.
-  (void)onScrollChange:(NSInteger)currentPage pageCount:(NSInteger)pageCount subViewModel:(ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel *)subViewModel {
    // The UI can be updated based on the parameters returned by the callback, including the current displayed page/current animation step.
}
```

You can use [setOperationMode](@setOperationMode) to grant permissions for clients to operate on the whiteboard.

On the clients with the corresponding permission, users can draw on the whiteboard. For details, refer to [Draw on a whiteboard](../Basic%20Function/Sketch.mdx).

### Switch to the common whiteboard, draw on the whiteboard, and zoom in

To synchronize the zooming effect among multiple parties, you must enable the zooming effect synchronization and responding functions on each party.

```objc
// The zooming effect needs to be synchronized between the local and peer parties.
[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].enableSyncScale = YES;// Synchronize the zooming effect to the other party.
[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].enableResponseScale = YES;// Respond to the zooming effect synchronized from the other party.
```

User A switches to the common whiteboard, uses the text tool to write on the whiteboard, and uses gestures to zoom in or out.
```objc
// Operations by user A
// Switch to the target whiteboard.
[[ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].superBoardView switchSuperBoardSubView:uniqueID complete:^(ZegoSuperBoardError errorCode) {
     // The default whiteboard tool is brush. To set other tool types, call setToolType.
     // For example, set the tool type to text, click on the whiteboard where you want to display the text, and enter the text.
     [ZegoSuperBoardManager sharedInstance].toolType = ZegoSuperBoardToolText;
}];
```

After user A switches the whiteboard, the switching is automatically synchronized to user B. User B receives the  `onRemoteSuperBoardSubViewSwitched` notification, which has been implemented in the preceding step.
