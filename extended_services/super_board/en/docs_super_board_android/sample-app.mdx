Here we provide you with a sample application to experience the ZEGOCLOUD's Super Board, and the following describes how to run the sample code.


### Prerequisites
- Android Studio 4.0 or later.
- Android SDK Packages: Android SDK 30, Android SDK Platform-Tools 30 or later.
- An Android device or Simulator that is running on Android 5.0 or later and supports audio and video. We recommend you use a real device (Remember to enable the USB debugging).
- The Android device is connected to the internet.

- Contact the ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to get the AppID and AppSign for SDK integration.



<Warning title="Warning">

- By default, the features of this product are not enabled. To use these features, you will need to contact ZEGOCLOUD Technical Support to enable them first.
- For SDK version `2.3.0 or later`, you can also use Tokens for authentication. To upgrade the authentication mode, refer to the [Upgrade the authentication mode from AppSign to Token](https://docs.zegocloud.com/faq/token_upgrade).

3. Modify the `KeyCenter.java` file with the AppID and AppSign (remember to add an "L" after the AppID) that you get in the **Prerequisites** steps.

```java
public class KeyCenter {

    public final static long APP_ID = YOUR_APP_ID;
    public final static String APP_SIGN = YOUR_APP_SIGN;

}
```

4. Connect the Android device to your computer, after you enabled the **developer mode** and **USB debugging** on the device, the option box in the upper place of Android Studio changes like the following, which means you are ready to run the sample code on the Android device.
