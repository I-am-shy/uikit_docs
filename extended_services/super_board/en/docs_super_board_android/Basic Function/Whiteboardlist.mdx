# Get the whiteboard list

- - -

This document describes how to obtain the list of whiteboards that are being shared in a room.

## Prerequisites

Create a whiteboard by referring to [Getting started\|_blank](!QuickStart/CreateWboard).

## Implementation process
1. If you enter a room for the first time, you can proactively fetch the list of whiteboards created in the room.

```java
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().querySuperBoardSubViewList(new IZegoSuperBoardQueryListCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onQuery(int errorCode, ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel[] subViewModelList, HashMap<String, String> extraInfo) {
        if (errorCode == ZegoSuperBoardError.ZegoSuperBoardSuccess) {
            /** The whiteboard list is obtained. */
            // After subViewModelList is obtained, update the whiteboard list on the interface.
            // For example, update them to the recyclerView list.
        } else {
            /** Failed to obtain the whiteboard list. Check the cause based on the error code. */
        }
    }
});
```


2. If you are already in a room, you will need to obtain the list of all whiteboards.

```java
// Call the getSuperBoardSubViewModelList() method.
List<ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel> modelList = ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().getSuperBoardSubViewModelList();
// Process the corresponding service logic.
```
