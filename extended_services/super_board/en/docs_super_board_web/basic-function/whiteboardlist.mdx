# Get the whiteboard list

- - -

This document describes how to obtain the list of whiteboards that are being shared in a room.

## Prerequisites

Creat a whiteboard by referring to [Create a super board](../quick-start/create-white-board.mdx).

## Implementation process
1. If you enter a room for the first time, you can proactively fetch the list of whiteboards created in the room.

```javascript

ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().querySuperBoardSubViewList().then(function(zegoSuperBoardSubViewModelList){
    // After ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel is obtained, update the whiteboard list on the page.
    // For example, update them to the UI list.
})
```


2. If you are already in a room, you will need to obtain the list of all whiteboards.

```javascript
ZegoSuperBoardManager.getInstance().querySuperBoardSubViewList().then(function(zegoSuperBoardSubViewModelList){
    // After ZegoSuperBoardSubViewModel is obtained, update the whiteboard list on the page.
    // Process the corresponding service logic.
})

```
