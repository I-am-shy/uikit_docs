# Customize the seat-taking logic

## Customize your own business logic

### API

<Note title="Note"> 
The following APIs are all called from `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoomController().seat`.
</Note>

- speaker
  - `speaker.leave`(\{bool showDialog = true\}): 

    Voluntarily leave a seat. 

    A pop-up confirmation prompt will show when the `showDialog` is `true`.

- host
  - `host.removeSpeaker`(String userID)`: Remove the speaker from the seat.
  - `host.close`(\{int targetIndex = -1\}): 

    Close(lock) the seat, allows you to close all seats or only close specific seat by `targetIndex`. 

    once all seats are closed, the audience can only take the seat by inviting by the host or sending a seat-taking request.
  - `host.open`(\{int targetIndex = -1\}): 

    Open(unlock) the seat, allows you to open all seats or only open specific seat by `targetIndex`.

    once it is opened, the audience can take the seat by clicking it.
  - `host.acceptTakingRequest`(String audienceUserID): The host accepts the audience's seat-taking request.
  - `host.rejectTakingRequest`(String audienceUserID): The host rejects the audience's seat-taking request.
  - `host.inviteToTake`(String userID): The host invites the audience to take a speaker seat.
  - `host.mute`(\{int targetIndex = -1, bool muted = true,\}): 

    Mute the user at the `targetIndex` seat.

    After mute, if you want to un-mute, you can set `muted` to false.

    And on side of the user at the `targetIndex` seat, return true/false in the callback of `ZegoLiveAudioRoomAudioVideoEvents.onMicrophoneTurnOnByOthersConfirmation` to open microphone or not.
  - `host.muteByUserID`(String targetUserID, \{bool muted = true, \}):

    Mute the seat by `targetUserID`.

    After mute, if you want to un-mute, you can set `muted` to false.

    And on side of the user at the `targetIndex` seat, return true/false in the callback of `ZegoLiveAudioRoomAudioVideoEvents.onMicrophoneTurnOnByOthersConfirmation` to open microphone or not.
- audience 
  - `audience.applyToTake`: The audience applies to take a speaker seat.
  - `audience.cancelTakingRequest`: The audience cancels his seat-taking request.
  - `audience.acceptTakingInvitation`: The audience accepts the seat-taking invite from the host.

### config

- [ZegoLiveAudioRoomLayoutConfig](./03-Customize%20the%20seats.mdx#customize-the-seat-layout) `layout`:

  The default layout of the audio chat room supports free layout with multiple rows and columns of seats.

  You can use this parameter to control the specific style of each row and column.

- int `takeIndexWhenJoining`:

  Specifies the seat to occupy when joining the live audio room.

  This is only valid when the role is set to host or speaker.

- int Function(ZegoUIKitUser user)? `takeIndexWhenAudienceRequesting`:

  When the audience take on seat, do you want specify a seat? If so, return to the seat you want to specify

- bool `closeWhenJoining`:

  Specifies whether to lock the seat automatically after entering the room.

  It only takes effect when set by the host, the default value is `true`.

- List\<int\> `hostIndexes`:

  Specifies the list of seats occupied by the host.

  Once specified, these seats can only be used by the host and cannot be occupied by speakers or audience members.

  The default value is `[0]`.

### event callbacks

<Note title="Note">
The `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatEvents.onClicked` and `ZegoLiveAudioRoomMemberListEvents.onMoreButtonPressed` overrides Live Audio Room Kit's prebuilt logic, meaning that when you customize these events, the prebuilt events are no longer executed.
</Note>

- ZegoLiveAudioRoomMemberListEvents
    - Function(ZegoUIKitUser user)? `onMoreButtonPressed`: This callback will be triggered when the more button in the member list is pressed. 
- ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatEvents
    - Function(int index, ZegoUIKitUser? user) `onClicked`: This callback will be triggered when a seat is clicked. 
    - Function() `onClosed`: This callback will be triggered when a speaker seat is closed. 
    - Function() `onOpened`: This callback will be triggered when a closed speaker seat is opened. 
    - Function(Map&lt;int/*seat index*/, ZegoUIKitUser&gt; takenSeats, List&lt;int&gt; untakenSeats) `onChanged`: This callback will be triggered when someone gets on/gets off/switches seat. 
    - ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatHostEvents
        - Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience) `onTakingRequested`: The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience applies to take a seat.

        - Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience) `onTakingRequestCanceled`: The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience cancels his seat-taking request.
        - VoidCallback? `onTakingInvitationFailed`: The host will receive a notification via this callback when a seat-taking invite failed.
        - void Function(ZegoUIKitUser audience)? `onTakingInvitationRejected`: The host will receive a notification via this callback when the audience rejects the seat-taking invite.  
    - ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatAudienceEvents
        - VoidCallback? `onTakingRequestFailed`: The audience will receive a notification via this callback when his seat-taking request fails.
        - VoidCallback? `onTakingRequestRejected`: The audience will receive a notification via this callback when his seat-taking request is rejected by the host.
        - VoidCallback? `onTakingInvitationReceived`: The audience will receive a notification via this callback when the host invites them to take a seat.

## Customize the audience's seat-taking logic

The reference code below implements the following:

1. Decide whether to show the "apply to take a seat" button.

- Listen to the `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatEvents.onClosed` and `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatEvents.onOpened`, you can tell whether the seat is open or closed. If open, the button shows. If closed, the button shall be hidden.

2. How to know whether a seat-taking request is sent?

- Listen to the `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatAudienceEvents.onTakingRequestFailed` and `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatAudienceEvents.onTakingRequestRejected` callbacks, and you can tell when the request is sent successfully via these callbacks.
- Listen to the `takenSeats`in the callback `ZegoLiveAudioRoomSeatEvents.onChanged`, you can tell when the audience takes a seat successfully.

3. How to **apply to take a seat** and **cancel the seat-taking request**?

- To send a seat-taking request, use the `applyToTake` method in `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoomController().seat.audience`.
- To cancel the seat-taking request after applying, use the `cancelTakingRequest` method in `ZegoUIKitPrebuiltLiveAudioRoomController().seat.audience`.
- And sure, these methods will return a result, you can do further logic customization based on the returned results.
