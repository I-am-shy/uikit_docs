- For your convenience during development and debugging, we provide the ZEGO Token Assistant to generate temporary Tokens.
- For business security, you must generate Tokens on your app server; Otherwise, there is a risk of ServerSecret being stolen.
- After generating a Token on your own server, if you need to verify its validity, you can also use the ZEGO Token Assistant for verification.
