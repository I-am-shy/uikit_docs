Add the screen recording permission configuration to the **AndroidManifest.xml** file of your project.

<Note title="Note">

Before recording the screen, a dialog will prompt the user to allow the app to record the screen. 

The user needs to manually grant permission.

</Note>

The screen recording feature relies on foreground service to keep the app alive. 

Go to the **"app/src/main"** directory of your project and open the **"AndroidManifest.xml"** file to add the permission declaration.

- If the target Android SDK version is **lower than version 34.0.0**, you need to set the **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** permission declaration.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
```

- If the target Android SDK version is **34.0.0 or later**, you need to set the **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** and **FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION** permission declarations.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE"/>
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION"/>
```
