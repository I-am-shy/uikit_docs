Your app clients request Tokens from your app server and provide the Token for privilege validation when logging in to a room. 

The following diagram shows the process of room login privilege validation:

1. Your app client requests a Token from your app server.
2. Your app server generates a Token and passes it to the client.
3. Your app client logs in to a room with userID, roomID, and the Token.
4. The ZEGOCLOUD SDK sends the Token to the ZEGO server for validation.
5. The ZEGOCLOUD server returns the validation result to the ZEGO Express SDK.
6. The ZEGOCLOUD SDK returns the validation result to the app client. If the validation passes, the user logs in to the room successfully; otherwise, the login fails.
