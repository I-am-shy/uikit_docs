# Migrating React Navigation to v7

If you upgrade to React Navigation v7, change the method you use to return to the previous screen from `navigate` to `popTo`.

For example, after upgrading to React Navigation v7, when you navigate from `HomePage` to `HostPage` and then want to return to `HomePage`, you should call `props.navigation.popTo('HomePage')` instead of `props.navigation.navigate('HomePage')`.
