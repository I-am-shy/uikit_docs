# Migrating to v2.4.1

In version 2.4.1, we have added a new dependency library to retrieve device information. After upgrading to the latest version, we need to add this dependency library.

If you want to upgrade to a version equal to or greater than this one, please run the following command to install the `react-native-device-info` dependency.

<CodeGroup>

yarn add react-native-device-info @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2
```
```bash title="npm"
npm install react-native-device-info @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2
