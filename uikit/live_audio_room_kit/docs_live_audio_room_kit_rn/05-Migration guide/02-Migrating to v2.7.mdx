# Migrating to v2.7

In version 2.7, we have added a new dependency library to retrieve device information. After upgrading to the latest version, we need to add this dependency library.

If you want to upgrade to a version equal to or greater than this one, please run the following command to install the `react-native-device-info` dependency.

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="yarn"
yarn add react-native-device-info @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2 zego-zim-react-native@2.16.0
```
```bash title="npm"
npm install react-native-device-info @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2 zego-zim-react-native@2.16.0
```
