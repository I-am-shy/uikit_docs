# Display Incoming Calls on Lock Screen

This document describes how to display incoming calls on device's lock screen.
## Implementation Process

To display incoming calls on the lock screen, simply add the following permission to your app module's manifest file:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT">
```

Note: 
1. If your app needs to upload you app to Google Play Store, due to [Google Play Store's policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?hl=en), you may need to make corresponding declarations for the permission to avoid rejection.

2. If your device has additional settings for lock screen display, allow them for this feature to work properly.
