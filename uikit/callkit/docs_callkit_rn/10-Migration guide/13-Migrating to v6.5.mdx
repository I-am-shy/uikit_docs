# Migrating to v6.5.0

From version 6.5.0, we have added a dependency library to generate UUID. After upgrading to the latest version, you need to add this dependency library.

If you want to upgrade to a version equal to or greater than this one, please run the following command to install the `react-native-uuid@^2.0.3` dependency.

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="yarn"
yarn add react-native-uuid@^2.0.3
```
</CodeGroup>
