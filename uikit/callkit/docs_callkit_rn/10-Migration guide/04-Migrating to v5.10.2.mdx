# Migrating to v5.10.2

In version 5.10.2, we have added two new dependency libraries to our project, the first is designed to retrieve device information, and the second supports push notifications for iOS devices. After upgrading to the latest version, we need to add these dependency libraries.

If you want to upgrade to a version equal to or greater than this one, please run the following command to install the `react-native-device-info` and `zego-callkit-react-native@1.0.6` dependency.

<CodeGroup>
```bash title="yarn"
yarn add react-native-device-info zego-callkit-react-native@1.0.6 zego-zim-react-native@2.16.0 zego-zpns-react-native@2.6.6 @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2
```
```bash title="npm"
npm install react-native-device-info zego-callkit-react-native@1.0.6 zego-zim-react-native@2.16.0 zego-zpns-react-native@2.6.6 @zegocloud/zego-uikit-rn@^2.14.2
